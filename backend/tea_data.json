            "about": "Black tea is tea that has been fully oxidized (sometimes referred to as being 'fermented' although it is not a true fermentation process). Both the leaves and brewed tea tend to have a dark color, although some black teas are golden or greenish in color. In Chinese, black tea is called h\u00f3ngch\u00e1, meaning red tea, although in English, red tea more often refers to rooibos, an herbal tea that is not made from the tea plant. Black tea also tends to contain more tannins, chemicals giving the tea its characteristic dark color. The tannins are actually a form of antioxidants, and are the chemicals that the catechins of green tea are transformed to when they undergo oxidation. Black tea is the most popular and widespread type of tea in the world, and makes up the bulk of the world's tea production and consumption; outside of southeast Asia, an overwhelming majority of the tea produced and consumed is black tea. In many cultures, when people say tea, they are referring to black tea. Black tea is grown in many countries and comes in many styles and grades; it is hard to generalize about the flavor or aroma of black teas. Black tea is the only type of tea that is widely classified into grades of tea using a system of letters, like OP, FTGFOP, BOP, etc. It is a widespread assumption that black teas are stronger, more bitter, and more heavily caffeinated than green teas; this is not true: green teas can be quite bitter, and black teas can be mellow. The strength of tea depends both on how it is brewed and the style and grade of tea used. The caffeine content also varies greatly from one tea to the next and depends on how the tea is brewed--and it is not safe to assume that black tea contains more caffeine than green or other types of tea. In general, black teas with more tips / leaf buds such as golden monkey are the most heavily-caffeinated of black teas, and souchongs, made out of larger leaves, are less caffeinated. Black teas used in English Breakfast and Irish Breakfast blends are usually deliberately chosen for their moderate-to-high caffeine content. Brewing tea is a complex art and is also a matter of peronal taste. In general, black teas tend to taste best when brewed with boiling water. A rare exception to this rule are a few of the lightest black teas, like some Darjeeling first flush, a few of which produce better results when brewed with water slightly below the boiling point. The optimal steeping times of black teas vary widely; strong, broken-leaf black teas infuse quickly and often taste best with brief steeping times, sometimes only about 1 minute, whereas other teas may taste best if steeped as long as 5-8 minutes. Black tea typically stays fresh and retains its flavor longer than green or white teas. A typical black tea, properly stored in a dark, airtight container, can be stored for 2 years or more with little difference in flavor. Some more delicate black teas, however, like Darjeeling first flush, do not always store as well. See our article on storing tea for more info.",

                "Spring 2022. 'Classic' Yunnan aroma. mild, nothing distinctive. Liquor (5 min steep, using the Breville tea machine) is a nice brown with a slight gold tinge. Tasty, great for sipping. PS: The leaves are long. I might have used less tea than actually needed for a full 6 cup pot. Next pot I will crush the leaves into smaller pieces for a more accurate measuring.",

                "Classic Yunnan aroma with a solid earthiness and a hint of spice. The liquor (5 min steep) is a medium amber brown. Good taste, with a subtle hint of spice. This is a great tea for an all sipping experience.",
                "I tried this tea right when I ordered it, but did not like it. It had few objectionable qualities, and was actually quite smooth, but simply seemed a little boring. However, I set it in my cupboard for quite some time and sure enough, it has started tasting more interesting after about a year and a half. Still, it is not my favorite and I thought it was expensive relative to how much I enjoyed it. The dry leaf has a rather different aroma from most of the Yunnan red teas I've tried. The smell reminds me a lot of the larger-leaf Assam teas I ordered from TeaOrb a while back. There is more of a fermented (and I mean fermented, not oxidized) smell, a sort of smell reminiscent of decaying autumn leaves, with some deep fruity and herbaceous notes. The brewed cup is very interesting. The flavor is exceptionally smooth, in my opinion, too much so. I prefer teas to have a bit more body. However the smoothness allows you to brew this tea more strongly, to bring out more complexity in the flavor. The flavor is quite sweet, and lightly savory/umami, but there is little bitterness or sourness. At times the cup reminds me of some Japanese green teas, flavor-wise. The aroma has a lot going on, but is subtle. Fleeting notes appear, vanish, then reappear. Notes include a nice floral honey, autumn leaves (less than from the smell of the dry leaf), and fruitiness but it's hard to pin down on a specific fruit. The fruitiness of the brewed cup is more like fresh fruit, contrasting with the dry leaf which suggested dried fruit. One thing that was interesting to me about aging is that I found after letting this tea sit for about a year and a half, the floral notes seemed stronger, which surprised me, as those notes are often not the type that stick around in a tea's aroma as you age it. The tea resteeps well. Some aromatic notes come out in the resteeps that were not present initially, such as cinnamon notes or notes of wood, faintly smoky. Some of the subsequent steeps can have a more oolong-like character. However I think it may be exaggerating to say this can be steeped 8+ times gong fu style. Perhaps this tea just wasn't suited for my tastes, but I found because it was too smooth and lacked the bitterness that I often seek out in tea, I found it gave out much earlier than that. But I also thought that all steeps were somehow unsatisfying to me, no matter how I brewed it. This tea was interesting, and I can recognize that quality craftsmanship went into its production, but in the end I did not enjoy it as much as the robust Yunnan teas. Some of them had at least as much aromatic complexity, but more body and flavour. I also thought it was quite pricey. Some of my favorite teas from Yunnan Sourcing cost little more than half as much as this one, yet I enjoy them much more. So, for someone with my taste, I thought this was overpriced. Someone who likes very smooth, sweet, mellow teas and dislikes bitterness and astrigency might enjoy this one more."

            "about": "Assam is a region of India and a variety and style of black tea. Although the region produces a small number of green teas, Assam green teas are very uncommon; when a tea is referred to as 'Assam' it invariably means black tea. Assam is further identified by means of production into CTC (Crush, Tear, Curl, a mechanical process) and orthodox (traditionally produced) tea. CTC tea is cheaper and infuses faster, whereas orthodox tea tends to be more expensive, more complex, and require longer brewing times. Assam is produced from a large-leafed variety of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis assamica, a different variety from both Chinese teas and teas in the Darjeeling district of India. This variety, although associated with Assam, is sometimes grown in other regions. Assam teas have a unique flavor both due to the low altitude of the Assam region and the special variety of tea plant used. The aroma of Assam teas is often described as malty. Most Assam teas are described as strong and powerful; Assam is one of the most common ingredients in breakfast blends and strong black tea blends, particularly Irish Breakfast and Ostfriesen tea. However, Assam teas are diverse and there are smoother and subtler black teas produced in this region as well.",

                "This was a rather strong, but high-quality Assam sold for an exceptionally good price. The dry leaf has a potent aroma, spicy and fruity. I already notice the raspberry notes even in the dry leaf. But the aroma somehow betrays a slight harshness: I can tell this is going to be a tea with a bit of an edge, even before I brew it. The brewed cup is exactly what I expect from the aroma: bold, strong, sharp flavor, moderately tannic and also bitter, with an undertone of savory, sour, and slightly sweet flavors. Thick and satisfying, but can be a bit much, depending on the mood you're in. If you want one of those kick-you-in-the-face breakfast teas this would be a good candidate. One thing I liked about this though, with respect to flavor and mouthfeel, is that the harshness is more up-front, and the finish is smoother and sweeter, and the lingering sensations on the palate are pleasing. The aroma of the brewed cup is fairly typical for an Assam, malty and fruity and slightly floral, but, just like the description, there are distinct notes of raspberry in there. I like it. I could see this tea pairing well with scones for this reason, creating somewhat of a 'raspberry jam' vibe even with plain scones. This tea resteeps fairly well and retains a similar character in the second steep. Interestingly though, I found that the first steep tasted better as it cooled, whereas the resteep was really only good when still hot, and tasted unpleasantly harsh and not as satisfying when it had cooled. I recommend going a bit easy on the leaf, if brewed too strongly this tea can get a little overwhelming. I don't drink tea with milk but this one might be a good candidate for adding milk to. The price is very good.$8.80 for 4 ounces, you rarely see a tea of this grade and quality for this price. I highly recommend this. Yes, it's not my favorite Assam I ordered from S&V, but it's A LOT cheaper and still very enjoyable. If you're looking for a bargain buy this is a great option, especially if you like the stronger, bolder Assams.",

For how normal this tea is though, it is a bit expensive so that's why the value is a bit lower for me. There are so many other cheap teas that are just this good in my opinion.

            "about": "Ceylon black tea is a widely-consumed type of black tea, grown in Sri Lanka; as with India, most of the tea production in Sri Lanka is of black tea. Ceylon is an old name for Sri Lanka which has stopped being used for the country outside of tea circles. Ceylon black tea is one of the most common teas in British tea culture, consumed on its own, used in breakfast blends, and frequently used as the base for flavored teas, like Earl Grey and various fruit teas. Typical Ceylon black teas have a middle-of-the-road character, bolder and darker than most Darjeeling teas, but slightly lighter and less malty than a typical Assam. Ceylon tea is diverse in quality and characteristics; much of it is mass-produced in large plantations and is used primarily in blending. Some single-estate Ceylon black teas are highly regarded, although they typically are not as well-known or expensive as teas from the Darjeeling or Assam regions of India. The leaf size and style also varies widely. A particular grade, OPA, is common in Ceylon and relatively uncommon in other areas. Ceylon OPA is a very bold, long-leaf tea with much larger leaves than the regular orange pekoe grade, but less delicate or wiry than the pricier OP1 grade. Ceylon teas are typically grouped by altitude into three categories: high-grown, mid-grown, and low-grown, each of which having its own unique attributes. Low-grown teas are produced at 1,500-1,800 foot elevations, mid-grown from 1,800-3,500, and high-grown form 3,500 to 7,500.[1] There are higher and lower quality teas from all altitude regions, and it can be hard to generalize about quality from altitude alone. The characteristics of Ceylon black tea also vary regionally, owing to different patterns of precipitation created by the steep topography of the island. Two important regions are Nuwara Eliya, producing high-grown Ceylon tea, and the Uva region, producing teas with unique characteristics resulting from its unique climate. Buying single-estate teas or single-region blends can allow you to taste and experience the unique flavors created by each of these regions. ",

Of those teas, this one tasted most similar to Ahmad's Ceylon OPA, but I liked it better. The dry leaf is dark, wiry, and consisting of surprisingly intact pieces of leaf (especially for the FBOP1 grade.) It's only subtly aromatic, with deep fruity notes but not much else. The leaf's appearance was more impressive to me than its smell. Brews a very dark cup. The flavor and mouthfeel is extremely clean and crisp. The aroma is quite complex, and exceeded my expectations set up by the leaf: the deep fruity notes from the dry leaf definitely come out, but on top of this there is a pleasant toasty quality, almost slightly smoky, and hints of wood and grain. The aroma is slightly reminiscent of some darker Chinese oolongs, ones with both oxidation and roast, but the overall drinking experience is more typical for a black tea. The cup is smooth, even if brewed very strongly. I found this tea easy to brew as it tastes good whether brewed mild or strong. When brewed stronger, there is a pleasantly astringent finish, not too much, just enough to make this tea brisk and refreshing. It also resteeps very well, probably because the large pieces of leaf infuse slowly. I also found this tea made good iced tea. It tends to produce iced tea that is a bit thinner but more refreshing, sort of deep and dark but pleasantly cooling. I highly recommend this one, especially to people who like darker oolongs as well as strong black teas, as this one seemed to combine aspects of both. The value is exceptional, I forget exactly what I paid for this but it was around $8 for 14 ounces and I thought that was a great deal. I only wish this tea were more widely available.

Ceylon is an old name for Sri Lanka which has stopped being used for the country outside of tea circles. Ceylon black tea is one of the most common teas in British tea culture, consumed on its own, used in breakfast blends, and frequently used as the base for flavored teas, like Earl Grey and various fruit teas. Typical Ceylon black teas have a middle-of-the-road character, bolder and darker than most Darjeeling teas, but slightly lighter and less malty than a typical Assam. Ceylon tea is diverse in quality and characteristics; much of it is mass-produced in large plantations and is used primarily in blending. Some single-estate Ceylon black teas are highly regarded, although they typically are not as well-known or expensive as teas from the Darjeeling or Assam regions of India. The leaf size and style also varies widely. A particular grade, OPA, is common in Ceylon and relatively uncommon in other areas. Ceylon OPA is a very bold, long-leaf tea with much larger leaves than the regular orange pekoe grade, but less delicate or wiry than the pricier OP1 grade. Ceylon teas are typically grouped by altitude into three categories: high-grown, mid-grown, and low-grown, each of which having its own unique attributes.

            "about": "Darjeeling black tea, usually just called Darjeeling is one of the most well-known and highly-regarded varieties of black tea, produced in the Darjeeling district of India, located in the northeast of India on the border with Nepal. Darjeeling black tea is often categorized by flush, the time of year at which the tea leaves are harvested. Darjeeling tea is produced by different tea gardens, and the higher-quality teas from this region are often sold as single-estate teas, marked as originating from a particular estate. Darjeeling tends to be lighter than other black teas, although teas from this region are diverse. For this reason, Darjeeling is often a favorite for afternoon tea, either on its own, or as an ingredient in lighter afternoon blends, in British tea culture. Some Darjeelings have an aroma that resembles muscatel grapes, a variety of grape sometimes used for wine. These Darjeelings share this quality with some bai hao oolong, a Chinese oolong tea that also often resembles muscatel grapes. Unlike most black teas, Darjeeling teas often have a substantial portion of greener (less oxidized) leaves mixed in, which gives the dry leaves a diversity of colors. In some cases, such as with some high-grown first flush Darjeelings, the leaf is entirely green in color. Brewed Darjeeling tea has a wide range of color; many Darjeelings are an amber color, lighter in hue than most other black teas. Some Darjeelings, especially the highly-desired first flush teas, are less oxidized and are more like oolongs than black teas, although these teas are distinct from proper Darjeeling oolongs. Other regions of India, such as Sikkim, and nearby regions outside of India, such as Nepal, produce teas in a similar style to Darjeeling tea. Teas from these regions are not referred to as Darjeeling, but are often categorized by the same system of flushes. These areas together form the Himalayan region of tea production.",

(Side note: The best by date isn't for about 2 years, so that's not the issue.) Some teas have a very, very light scent, though. So, I tried to suspend judgment and brewed a cup as the packaging specified. The water did turn color, lightly, so clearly the tea did infuse. But, there wasn't much of any taste. Sometimes, teas have a different (even stronger) taste when you leave them to cool. That wasn't hard to do, because drinking what tastes like hot water is not appealing to me. Yet, when it cooled a bit, there was still virtually no taste. As if this weren't bad enough, the tea (if you can even give it that label) made me jittery -- really, really jittery. It was as if everything were somehow sucked out of this tea, except for an insane amount of hand-shaking, spine-trembling caffeine. (An unusual reaction for me to have to any tea, let alone a black tea, which typically gives me an alert calmness.) I'd had Darjeeling from Twinings and it did have a taste (it also didn't give me that strange jittery reaction). So, I suspected something was seriously wrong. I looked up articles and tried brewing the tea with a different recipe (i.e. amount of tea, temperature, duration, etc.). But, it still turned out basically the same. Just to make sure I gave this tea every possible chance I could, I contacted the company. They were courteous, but they weren't any help at all. I really tried to make this work, and I can only think of one other finicky tea that I've had in my life that I may have brewed more times and given more chances than this. But, it was all to no avail. Insofar as tea is an ideally fragrant dried leaf which produces an ideally fragrant and tasty beverage when infused in water, this fails to even qualify as tea. If you like tea that has no scent and no taste, I have good news for you! This is actually called 'hot water' and can be gotten without the need for spending $12.50 on a tin. Simply bring water to a boil in a kettle, then pour out into a mug and add honey and/or lemon to taste. Then, you can save that $12.50 for a rainy day or give it to charity.

            "about": "Darjeeling first flush or first flush Darjeeling tea designates Darjeeling tea that has been harvested at a specific time, immediately following spring rains. Although technically classified as a black tea, first flush Darjeeling tea has often a lighter, often greenish color and can be much milder than most black teas. Many first flush Darjeeling teas are low in bitterness, but relatively high in astringency, and can have considerable natural sweetness. They often have a pronounced floral aroma as well, and some have a 'muscatel' aroma, suggesting muscat grapes. In many respects, these teas more closely resemble greener oolong teas in color, flavor, and aroma because the oxidation is less complete than in most black teas. However, they are usually considered distinct from proper Darjeeling oolongs. First flush Darjeeling is considered a highly desirable tea, and can be very expensive, although the range of prices is broad. Broken-leaf, single-estate first flush teas can sometimes be less expensive than whole-leaf, mixed-flush, blended Darjeeling. Because the qualities of each tea depend on the climate conditions of the particular year of harvest, the batches can vary considerably from year to year. In contrast to darker black teas, which most companies recommend brewing with boiling water, some companies recommend brewing first flush Darjeeling teas, especially lighter batches, with water that has cooled somewhat from boiling, around 180(degrees)-190(degrees)F. Whether or not this is necessary can vary hugely from one tea to the next. Niraj Lama of Happy Earth Tea, explains that high grades of Darjeeling first flush work exceptionally well with cold brewing, which he explains on a blog post on cold brewing Darjeeling.",

                "A tricky-to-brew tea that reminded me a lot of green oolongs from Taiwan, and required a lower water temperature to brew to satisfaction. The dry leaf, quite broken, is an intense green color, like a lot of good Darjeeling first flush. It looks exactly like pictured in the company photo (I appreciate honest photography!) Very fresh smell, a slight hint of sweet malt and strong floral and vegetal notes, honey-like, very fresh smelling too. I love the smell and I'm excited to try this. The brewed cup has a delightful aroma, with floral and vegetal notes resembling green oolongs, and that characteristic Darjeeling grape-like fruitiness. Like with some of these oolongs, the aroma is also slightly soapy though. I was a little disappointed the first couple times I brewed this. I found that brewing temperature was the secret: this tea really cannot handle boiling water. It made a BIG difference...with boiling water, the tea had some off qualities, was oddly thin yet too bitter and also oddly sour, and made me feel a bit jittery after drinking it. I even went a little lower than recommended, brewing this more like a green tea, at about 180(degrees)F/82(degrees)C, and this produced good results. Brewed ideally, the aromatic qualities of the leaf came out more. The cup was still a little thin-bodied, but the bitterness and sourness were reduced and the cup tasted more balanced. On the strong side for me, caffeine-wise. I wouldn't drink this one late in the day; it's good if you want a bit of a kick. Resteeped well; the second cup was a bit thin-bodied but retained a lot of the fresh, vegetal and floral, oolong-like aromatic qualities of the first. This tea was pricey, but not compared to other first-flush teas of this caliber. The main reason I'd say this tea doesn't offer the best value is that, to me, it's competing with similar-tasting Taiwanese teas of a lower price that are easier to brew, produce more infusions, and are less caffeinated. If you like very green first flush teas, and especially if you are also a fan of green Taiwanese oolongs like Pouchong / Bao Zhong or very green Dong Ding, you might really like this one. Just be careful with the brewing temperature; it's much pickier than an oolong.",
                "With the most prominent notes being pineapple, cranberry, and lemongrass, this tea is almost like drinking tart fruit juice. I love it because of that, but I can see others disliking it for the same reason. I taste a bit of honey as well. First flush is stereotyped as floral, but I don't get a lot of that here. There are some herbal notes, but they're more in the background. This was the most expensive tea I got at The Coffee and Tea Exchange, and it was still only $3/oz.

            "doc": "Darjeeling first flush or first flush Darjeeling tea designates Darjeeling tea that has been harvested at a specific time, immediately following spring rains. Although technically classified as a black tea, first flush Darjeeling tea has often a lighter, often greenish color and can be much milder than most black teas. Many first flush Darjeeling teas are low in bitterness, but relatively high in astringency, and can have considerable natural sweetness. They often have a pronounced floral aroma as well, and some have a 'muscatel' aroma, suggesting muscat grapes. In many respects, these teas more closely resemble greener oolong teas in color, flavor, and aroma because the oxidation is less complete than in most black teas. However, they are usually considered distinct from proper Darjeeling oolongs. First flush Darjeeling is considered a highly desirable tea, and can be very expensive, although the range of prices is broad. Broken-leaf, single-estate first flush teas can sometimes be less expensive than whole-leaf, mixed-flush, blended Darjeeling. Because the qualities of each tea depend on the climate conditions of the particular year of harvest, the batches can vary considerably from year to year. In contrast to darker black teas, which most companies recommend brewing with boiling water, some companies recommend brewing first flush Darjeeling teas, especially lighter batches, with water that has cooled somewhat from boiling, around 180(degrees)-190(degrees)F. Whether or not this is necessary can vary hugely from one tea to the next. Niraj Lama of Happy Earth Tea, explains that high grades of Darjeeling first flush work exceptionally well with cold brewing, which he explains on a blog post on cold brewing Darjeeling.Half-litre pot at home, made from a sample included in the tea company's Advent Tea Calendar (2020) and consisting of fine Darjeeling leaves in all shades of green and some brown ones, too. Pours clear lightish amber (against white china) with no sediment. Clear aroma of Darjeeling tea leaves, leafy and a little malty. Ditto flavour. Mildly astringent palate with a leafy aftertaste. A very nice Darjeeling. I normally prefer stronger teas, such as Assam or Ceylon, but this one is rather good. I might consider buying a regular portion one day. Definitely a reasonable price, given the context (ca. (euros)0.42 per 1 sample in the collection; regular portions are expensive, reaching (euros)12.70 per 100 g). 7 4 5 80 12 g / l; 100 C; 2 min. Review #150  Half-litre cup at home, made from fine small green, brown and yellow leaves. Pours clear peach yellow (against white china) with no sediment. Very mild aroma of fresh leaves, much faintier than the loose leaves themselves emit. Mild, leafy but fresh and pure flavour of black tea, with floral touches. A delicate palate, turning gradually more and more astringent, with a leafy aftertaste, but very far away in its intensity from the more pronounced and heavier sorts like Ceylon and Assam. A very delicate and enjoyable drink. Not exactly cheap but still within the limits of affordability ((euros)7.95 per 100 g). This is my first Darjeeling review, and I would definitely like to write some more. 8 4 3 85 12 g / l; 100 C; 2 min. Review #106  A tricky-to-brew tea that reminded me a lot of green oolongs from Taiwan, and required a lower water temperature to brew to satisfaction. The dry leaf, quite broken, is an intense green color, like a lot of good Darjeeling first flush. It looks exactly like pictured in the company photo (I appreciate honest photography!) Very fresh smell, a slight hint of sweet malt and strong floral and vegetal notes, honey-like, very fresh smelling too. I love the smell and I'm excited to try this. The brewed cup has a delightful aroma, with floral and vegetal notes resembling green oolongs, and that characteristic Darjeeling grape-like fruitiness. Like with some of these oolongs, the aroma is also slightly soapy though. I was a little disappointed the first couple times I brewed this. I found that brewing temperature was the secret: this tea really cannot handle boiling water. It made a BIG difference...with boiling water, the tea had some off qualities, was oddly thin yet too bitter and also oddly sour, and made me feel a bit jittery after drinking it. I even went a little lower than recommended, brewing this more like a green tea, at about 180(degrees)F/82(degrees)C, and this produced good results. Brewed ideally, the aromatic qualities of the leaf came out more. The cup was still a little thin-bodied, but the bitterness and sourness were reduced and the cup tasted more balanced. On the strong side for me, caffeine-wise. I wouldn't drink this one late in the day; it's good if you want a bit of a kick. Resteeped well; the second cup was a bit thin-bodied but retained a lot of the fresh, vegetal and floral, oolong-like aromatic qualities of the first. This tea was pricey, but not compared to other first-flush teas of this caliber. The main reason I'd say this tea doesn't offer the best value is that, to me, it's competing with similar-tasting Taiwanese teas of a lower price that are easier to brew, produce more infusions, and are less caffeinated. If you like very green first flush teas, and especially if you are also a fan of green Taiwanese oolongs like Pouchong / Bao Zhong or very green Dong Ding, you might really like this one. Just be careful with the brewing temperature; it's much pickier than an oolong. With the most prominent notes being pineapple, cranberry, and lemongrass, this tea is almost like drinking tart fruit juice. I love it because of that, but I can see others disliking it for the same reason. I taste a bit of honey as well. First flush is stereotyped as floral, but I don't get a lot of that here. There are some herbal notes, but they're more in the background. This was the most expensive tea I got at The Coffee and Tea Exchange, and it was still only $3/oz. That's a fantastic deal for tea this good.  I will likely revise this review after a few more times trying this tea. It seems high quality with a grassy quality, but I can't decide how I feel about the bitter undertones. I generally am not a fan of bitter teas. To be fair, it might be a fault of my brewing.

(Side note: The best by date isn't for about 2 years, so that's not the issue.) Some teas have a very, very light scent, though. So, I tried to suspend judgment and brewed a cup as the packaging specified. The water did turn color, lightly, so clearly the tea did infuse. But, there wasn't much of any taste. Sometimes, teas have a different (even stronger) taste when you leave them to cool. That wasn't hard to do, because drinking what tastes like hot water is not appealing to me. Yet, when it cooled a bit, there was still virtually no taste. As if this weren't bad enough, the tea (if you can even give it that label) made me jittery -- really, really jittery. It was as if everything were somehow sucked out of this tea, except for an insane amount of hand-shaking, spine-trembling caffeine. (An unusual reaction for me to have to any tea, let alone a black tea, which typically gives me an alert calmness.) I'd had Darjeeling from Twinings and it did have a taste (it also didn't give me that strange jittery reaction). So, I suspected something was seriously wrong. I looked up articles and tried brewing the tea with a different recipe (i.e. amount of tea, temperature, duration, etc.). But, it still turned out basically the same. Just to make sure I gave this tea every possible chance I could, I contacted the company. They were courteous, but they weren't any help at all. I really tried to make this work, and I can only think of one other finicky tea that I've had in my life that I may have brewed more times and given more chances than this. But, it was all to no avail. Insofar as tea is an ideally fragrant dried leaf which produces an ideally fragrant and tasty beverage when infused in water, this fails to even qualify as tea. If you like tea that has no scent and no taste, I have good news for you! This is actually called 'hot water' and can be gotten without the need for spending $12.50 on a tin. Simply bring water to a boil in a kettle, then pour out into a mug and add honey and/or lemon to taste. Then, you can save that $12.50 for a rainy day or give it to charity.

A tea that I like to savor very slowly, not something for if you're in a hurry. Thank you to Mighty Leaf for this generous sample! I love the smell of the loose-leaf, it smells refreshing and very much makes me want to brew up and drink this tea. It's slightly fruity and malty, with a skunky note. The brewed cup is rich and smooth, with just enough astringency to impart some body. The aroma is very similar to the dried leaf, it smells almost exactly like I'd expect from the leaf. More floral notes come out in the cup. The one thing I object to were the steeping instructions, which recommend a 4 minute steep, more than some of the stronger black teas from Mighty Leaf. Like some smoother Darjeelings, this tea can be oddly overbearing in a way not suggested by the flavor and aroma. I have to make sure not to brew it too strongly, not because it tastes too strong, but because I am not crazy about how I feel after drinking it. It feels pretty caffeinated. I had the best result using a little less than a teaspoon of leaf per cup, and only steeping for 2 minutes. This then led it to be resteeped more easily. If you're not as sensitive to caffeine (or whatever else is causing me to feel a bit jittery after drinking this) you may enjoy steeping it stronger; I loved the flavor but the effects on my body were too strong for me. Because this tea worked so well for me with such a small amount of leaf, the leaf stretches VERY far, so I think it is actually quite a good deal even though it is pricier than some of the other teas. I'd probably get 50(percent) more cups out of this per weight of the leaf, than, say, the Assams sold by Mighty Leaf.",

            "about": "Autumnal flush Darjeeling, often just called autumnal Darjeeling, Darjeeling Autumnal Flush, or less commonly, third flush, is Darjeeling tea that has been harvested after the autumn rainy season. It is often described as having a full-bodied and robust character, especially relative to the more delicate first and second flush teas, and tends to be darker in color, although it is lighter and more delicate than the monsoon/rains teas gathered between the second and autumnal flushes. The harvest dates of these teas are generally in October and November. Autumnal flush tends to have larger leaves than the teas from the first two flushes, although this difference can be slight relative to other teas, as most Darjeeling is still made out of small-leafed cultivars of the tea plant. Compared to teas of a similar grade and from similar gardens, Darjeeling tea from the autumnal flush tends to be less expensive than first or second flush teas, but more so than monsoon or rains teas or blends of tea from different flushes. However, it is hard to generalize about either price or quality; autumnal flushes of higher grades or from certain estates often fetch higher prices than first- or second-flush teas from others.",

                "This tea is subtly different from other Darjeelings. The leaf is big and looks more like a Wuyi oolong than anything from Darjeeling. The aroma is rich and deep, notes of caramel and malt, a hint of the characteristic fruity/floral/vegetal notes, more typical for an autumnal flush Darjeeling. Upon pouring the water, an interesting pungent note came out that I didn't notice at all in the dry leaf, reminding me of the Seeyok autumnal flush from Udyan tea that I recently sampled and reviewed. It's both fruity and skunky (not in a bad way). This tea also tastes very different from how it smells. There's a surprising note of clove, an aromatic note I rarely encounter in black tea, only in certain herbs (like tulsi and other basils). The cup also has this very slight, gentle edginess or sharpness, just enough to keep it interesting. It's less smooth than the dry leaf's smell suggests. This tea works very well when brewed more strongly, but you have to be careful not to oversteep. I like using a bit more than a teaspoon of leaf and steeping for five minutes but no longer. The only problem with this is that it doesn't resteep quite as well if the first steep is this long, but I still resteep it. It also works well with a 2-3 minute first steep if you want a very smooth, mellow cup. This tea was enjoyable and interesting, but it didn't stand out quite as much as some of the other teas from Udyan tea, like the Castleton china black or the Himalayan oolong. I thought the price was good, but not quite as much a steal as some of the prices on the other teas like the Castleton.",
                "I liked this tea, but I would not describe it as 'thunder'; it's too mellow. Following the rumbling sound analogy, it would be more like 'a natural-gas-powered bus goes by', but I guess that doesn't sound quite as sexy. Dry leaf has a strong aroma, mostly nutty, suggesting sweetness. The aroma suggests warmth. Upon brewing, though, the tea takes on a slightly more cooling character, with a balance of warming and cooling qualities. Aroma is nutty and also resembles autumn leaves with a hint of caramel. Flavor is very mild. This is an exceptionally mellow tea. There are floral and fruity hints but overall this tea is much less fruity than typical for a Darjeeling. There are some fresh notes, almost minty, in the finish. Smooth but to the point of being possibly uninteresting. The second cup is particularly uninteresting. I would call this a 'one hit wonder' because I really preferred steeping it only once (going 5 minutes or more) and then tossing the leaves. I was less a fan of this one among the samples Udyan tea recently sent me; the price is a little higher than some of the other offerings, yet I enjoyed it less, especially since it didn't seem to resteep as well.",
                "This was a dark, rich, smooth, and naturally sweet tea with a mysterious pungent aroma, which changed its character a lot resteeping. Dry leaf is a fairly uniform brown, and has a strong and intriguing aroma, malty and suggesting sweetness, but very fresh and light. As I pour the water, immediately a strong fruity smell, mostly suggesting grapes, emerges. There is a pungent, almost skunky note, which is not unpleasant, and is hard to describe. Unlike most Darjeelings, the grape aroma resembles concords a little more than muscat grapes. The aroma is also a little olive-like. This tea did not retain its character on resteeping. After a first, 3-minute steep, the fruitiness was completely gone, and the second cup smelled and tasted very different. It was more herbaceous and had some of the dark, skunky notes still. The aroma was also spicy, and in a peculiar way, suggesting nutmeg and black pepper. This second cup was enjoyable, but it was a completely different experience from the first. I found it full-bodied, crisp, and satisfying flavor-wise, especially relative to the typical second-steeps of Darjeelings, which often tend to be disappointingly thin and bland, even with some higher-quality teas. But the aromatic notes were mostly different. I was impressed with this tea. It's different and interesting, although I can't see it having a universal appeal, as its aromatic qualities are a bit strange. The price is very good though. I recommend this for someone who wants to taste something novel.",
                "Wow. Udyan tea recently sent me some samples, and they are of impressive quality. This is the first sample I'm reviewing, and only the second tea I've ever tried from Castleton estate. It got my attention immediately as a top-quality tea. The dry leaf of this tea is explosively aromatic and the aroma is extraordinarily fresh, strong, and complex. At first it smells like a Darjeeling, with strong fruity and floral qualities, but this quick falls into the background behind a spicy and malty aroma that reminds me a little of some Yunnan teas, or some other Chinese teas. And this is before brewing it! Upon brewing, produces a very smooth cup with a bold and fresh flavor. Fairly cooling for a black tea. Aroma is very floral and fruity, and has woody notes (like in the description, and a little like an amber oolong). Although the leaf looks darker, typical for a Darjeeling autumn flush, this tastes greener in character, like a first flush tea with a bit of the edge taken off. The second cup was surprisingly good. Interestingly, the second steep was when this tea really started to shine. It had a strong herbaceous character, a lot like hops, and the aroma was less like a typical Darjeeling, more malty. The net effect was that it reminded me of some craft-brewed beers. Bold flavor, and interesting. Slightly tricky to brew: easy to oversteep. This tea doesn't become too bitter or astringent, but it is somehow overbearing and unpleasant if brewed too strongly. I initially tried using a teaspoon of leaf and a 3 minute steep, and this came out too strong for my tastes. The aroma was pleasantly complex and the flavor good, but something about the cup was still too potent. I liked a 3 minute steep using less than a teaspoon, or a 1-2 minute steep using about a teaspoon. Brewing this tea less strongly brings out a honey-like sweetness. I usually liked brewing two cups but no more, the second cup was always outstanding, but the wonderful aromatic notes were mostly gone after that. The price on this is exceptional. This is a top-notch artisanal tea, and the leaf stretches very far. At under $6 for 100 grams, this is undoubtedly the best Darjeeling I've ever sampled in this price range. Udyan lists this as FTGFOP1, and it among the better examples of teas of this grade that I've tried, and it's also super fresh.",
                "This second-flush Darjeeling was very different from the other one from Jungpana estate, that I just tried from this same company. I prepared them the same ways. I didn't like this tea as much, but it was still good. The dry leaf is not quite as intensely aromatic, but has a fascinating aroma with a fleeting wintergreen note and a hint of malt. Upon brewing, the cup takes on a subdued quality reminding me of cool, clean stone in a forest. The cup has a strong cooling quality, more so than most autumn flush teas, which often seem more warming to me. There are interesting vegetal notes, and as the cup cools, the flavor and aroma of olive start to come out rather strongly. I like the initial aroma more than the olive notes. I tried varying the amount of leaf and steeping time, and I found that brewing strength didn't make much of a difference in the character of this tea...it only made it subtly stronger or weaker. Resteeps decently, only a second cup though, and not as interesting, a bit thin. Doesn't resteep quite as well as some Darjeelings. I was surprised to see this tea was more expensive than the autumn flush from Jungpana, which I strongly preferred to this one. This tea is priced pretty high, even with the sale price, but it didn't seem quite up to the level of teas I would want to buy at this price."

It is often described as having a full-bodied and robust character, especially relative to the more delicate first and second flush teas, and tends to be darker in color, although it is lighter and more delicate than the monsoon/rains teas gathered between the second and autumnal flushes. The harvest dates of these teas are generally in October and November. Autumnal flush tends to have larger leaves than the teas from the first two flushes, although this difference can be slight relative to other teas, as most Darjeeling is still made out of small-leafed cultivars of the tea plant. Compared to teas of a similar grade and from similar gardens, Darjeeling tea from the autumnal flush tends to be less expensive than first or second flush teas, but more so than monsoon or rains teas or blends of tea from different flushes. However, it is hard to generalize about either price or quality; autumnal flushes of higher grades or from certain estates often fetch higher prices than first- or second-flush teas from others.This tea is subtly different from other Darjeelings. The leaf is big and looks more like a Wuyi oolong than anything from Darjeeling. The aroma is rich and deep, notes of caramel and malt, a hint of the characteristic fruity/floral/vegetal notes, more typical for an autumnal flush Darjeeling. Upon pouring the water, an interesting pungent note came out that I didn't notice at all in the dry leaf, reminding me of the Seeyok autumnal flush from Udyan tea that I recently sampled and reviewed. It's both fruity and skunky (not in a bad way). This tea also tastes very different from how it smells. There's a surprising note of clove, an aromatic note I rarely encounter in black tea, only in certain herbs (like tulsi and other basils). The cup also has this very slight, gentle edginess or sharpness, just enough to keep it interesting. It's less smooth than the dry leaf's smell suggests. This tea works very well when brewed more strongly, but you have to be careful not to oversteep. I like using a bit more than a teaspoon of leaf and steeping for five minutes but no longer. The only problem with this is that it doesn't resteep quite as well if the first steep is this long, but I still resteep it. It also works well with a 2-3 minute first steep if you want a very smooth, mellow cup. This tea was enjoyable and interesting, but it didn't stand out quite as much as some of the other teas from Udyan tea, like the Castleton china black or the Himalayan oolong. I thought the price was good, but not quite as much a steal as some of the prices on the other teas like the Castleton. I liked this tea, but I would not describe it as 'thunder'; it's too mellow. Following the rumbling sound analogy, it would be more like 'a natural-gas-powered bus goes by', but I guess that doesn't sound quite as sexy. Dry leaf has a strong aroma, mostly nutty, suggesting sweetness. The aroma suggests warmth. Upon brewing, though, the tea takes on a slightly more cooling character, with a balance of warming and cooling qualities. Aroma is nutty and also resembles autumn leaves with a hint of caramel. Flavor is very mild. This is an exceptionally mellow tea. There are floral and fruity hints but overall this tea is much less fruity than typical for a Darjeeling. There are some fresh notes, almost minty, in the finish. Smooth but to the point of being possibly uninteresting. The second cup is particularly uninteresting. I would call this a 'one hit wonder' because I really preferred steeping it only once (going 5 minutes or more) and then tossing the leaves. I was less a fan of this one among the samples Udyan tea recently sent me; the price is a little higher than some of the other offerings, yet I enjoyed it less, especially since it didn't seem to resteep as well. This was a dark, rich, smooth, and naturally sweet tea with a mysterious pungent aroma, which changed its character a lot resteeping. Dry leaf is a fairly uniform brown, and has a strong and intriguing aroma, malty and suggesting sweetness, but very fresh and light. As I pour the water, immediately a strong fruity smell, mostly suggesting grapes, emerges. There is a pungent, almost skunky note, which is not unpleasant, and is hard to describe. Unlike most Darjeelings, the grape aroma resembles concords a little more than muscat grapes. The aroma is also a little olive-like. This tea did not retain its character on resteeping. After a first, 3-minute steep, the fruitiness was completely gone, and the second cup smelled and tasted very different. It was more herbaceous and had some of the dark, skunky notes still. The aroma was also spicy, and in a peculiar way, suggesting nutmeg and black pepper. This second cup was enjoyable, but it was a completely different experience from the first. I found it full-bodied, crisp, and satisfying flavor-wise, especially relative to the typical second-steeps of Darjeelings, which often tend to be disappointingly thin and bland, even with some higher-quality teas. But the aromatic notes were mostly different. I was impressed with this tea. It's different and interesting, although I can't see it having a universal appeal, as its aromatic qualities are a bit strange. The price is very good though. I recommend this for someone who wants to taste something novel. Wow. Udyan tea recently sent me some samples, and they are of impressive quality. This is the first sample I'm reviewing, and only the second tea I've ever tried from Castleton estate. It got my attention immediately as a top-quality tea. The dry leaf of this tea is explosively aromatic and the aroma is extraordinarily fresh, strong, and complex. At first it smells like a Darjeeling, with strong fruity and floral qualities, but this quick falls into the background behind a spicy and malty aroma that reminds me a little of some Yunnan teas, or some other Chinese teas. And this is before brewing it! Upon brewing, produces a very smooth cup with a bold and fresh flavor. Fairly cooling for a black tea. Aroma is very floral and fruity, and has woody notes (like in the description, and a little like an amber oolong). Although the leaf looks darker, typical for a Darjeeling autumn flush, this tastes greener in character, like a first flush tea with a bit of the edge taken off. The second cup was surprisingly good. Interestingly, the second steep was when this tea really started to shine. It had a strong herbaceous character, a lot like hops, and the aroma was less like a typical Darjeeling, more malty. The net effect was that it reminded me of some craft-brewed beers. Bold flavor, and interesting. Slightly tricky to brew: easy to oversteep. This tea doesn't become too bitter or astringent, but it is somehow overbearing and unpleasant if brewed too strongly. I initially tried using a teaspoon of leaf and a 3 minute steep, and this came out too strong for my tastes. The aroma was pleasantly complex and the flavor good, but something about the cup was still too potent. I liked a 3 minute steep using less than a teaspoon, or a 1-2 minute steep using about a teaspoon. Brewing this tea less strongly brings out a honey-like sweetness. I usually liked brewing two cups but no more, the second cup was always outstanding, but the wonderful aromatic notes were mostly gone after that. The price on this is exceptional. This is a top-notch artisanal tea, and the leaf stretches very far. At under $6 for 100 grams, this is undoubtedly the best Darjeeling I've ever sampled in this price range. Udyan lists this as FTGFOP1, and it among the better examples of teas of this grade that I've tried, and it's also super fresh. This second-flush Darjeeling was very different from the other one from Jungpana estate, that I just tried from this same company. I prepared them the same ways. I didn't like this tea as much, but it was still good. The dry leaf is not quite as intensely aromatic, but has a fascinating aroma with a fleeting wintergreen note and a hint of malt. Upon brewing, the cup takes on a subdued quality reminding me of cool, clean stone in a forest. The cup has a strong cooling quality, more so than most autumn flush teas, which often seem more warming to me. There are interesting vegetal notes, and as the cup cools, the flavor and aroma of olive start to come out rather strongly. I like the initial aroma more than the olive notes. I tried varying the amount of leaf and steeping time, and I found that brewing strength didn't make much of a difference in the character of this tea...it only made it subtly stronger or weaker. Resteeps decently, only a second cup though, and not as interesting, a bit thin. Doesn't resteep quite as well as some Darjeelings. I was surprised to see this tea was more expensive than the autumn flush from Jungpana, which I strongly preferred to this one. This tea is priced pretty high, even with the sale price, but it didn't seem quite up to the level of teas I would want to buy at this price."

Not per bag, but for the entire tin! That's the best value I've had for a good tea. However, you probably can't match that. So how costly is it, for real? A peek at the bottom of the 30-sachet tin revealed the original sticker price of $10.25 retail, since inflated to $12.89 on Amazon as of this writing. As my grown kids' former teen peers might have said, this had better be, 'like, you know, like, the best tea evaaaaarrrr' to justify that outlay. It ain't. But don't despair. I bet you won't regret drinking it if you can find it at a steep (pun intended) discount. Brewed best a bit longer than usual recommended times-try 5 minutes-this is a rich, almost savory black tea, with well-balanced, thick smoothness to it, and a nice, strong flavor that doesn't go overboard with any particular element (bitterness, astringency, etc.). The pyramidal sachets swell up nicely after steeping too, with noticeably more (and better) aroma than the rather bland dry-bag sniff test. This indicates that Harney doesn't skimp on quantity at all, and chooses a very good tea blend for this product. I'll be sad when this tin is done...not just because I'll never again get a reasonably high-quality black tea for less than a penny per bag, but because it's actually good enough to be worth somewhere about halfway between what I paid and the retail cost.",

                "Not great, but decent and tolerable: that's how I'll characterize this blend. In my relatively limited experience, many food-service black teas (including English Breakfasts) taste rather flat, hollow, sometimes excessively bitter, or often weak, as if they've either been allowed to sit out in the open for 20 years, or dug out of the dregs of some automated processing machine and sold to the lowest bidder. Almost all have feeble dry-bag aroma. So does this one, but that's where the 'Here we go again!' sentiment got cut short. While not the richest or most robust food-service all-black tea (Farmer Brothers still takes that crown for me), Rituals darkened up quickly and presented a pleasant drinking experience with the added identity of a smooth finish and clean aftertaste. It's a basic tea without much in the way of side flavors or undertones I could detect, but still nice to drink on two cool mornings: once at the vacation home in New Hampshire where it was provided, and once after returning home to my well water. Quantity wasn't sacrificed either, with the wet bag being duly swollen, and mildly aromatic of a somewhat above-average bagged black tea, especially for a food-service product. Odds are you'll do worse with most such teas, so when you find this one, you've got a true fighting chance to enjoy it instead of just get some caffeine poured down your gullet.",
                "When first opening the tin, the tea smells earthy and dusty, very much like an inexpensive Yunnan black tea. The leaves are quite large for loose leaf tea at this price, but there are more than a few twig fragments among the leaves. This also matches my experience with inexpensive Yunnan black tea. While brewing, the aroma is consistent with my initial impression. Earthy, faint cocoa, oak leaves. The tea has a nice flavor, but it's light and the tea is thin-bodied. There's an unexpected bitterness and raisin maltiness, cut with an oaky and tannic astringency. It flavor profile reminds me a bit of TATA Gold, which is a blend of Assam CTC and Darjeeling leaves, but without the strength. I keep wanting there to be more to this tea. It's not bad, it just tastes like a blend of cheap teas that is, if anything, less than the sum of its parts. The flavor and body are light enough that I have to struggle a bit to properly taste them. The finish is a nice cocoa, but also fleeting. I paid $7 for a 100g/3.5oz tin that is $11.00 from The Tao of Tea's online shop. $2/ounce isn't outrageous, but there are less expensive teas that I enjoy more, including straight CTC Assam or Yunnan black teas. I'd feel ripped off if I'd paid $3/ounce. I won't be buying more. EDIT: I intentionally oversteeped the tea (fifteen minutes) and it improved a lot. It balances a bit too bitter, but the cocoa shines through with some dried cherries, classic malt, and a hint of molasses. Maybe that's what they were going for. If I were blind-tasting the oversteeped tea, I'd guess it to be an average Sri Lankan tea. In any case, I bumped the rating a few points. It's still overpriced for the quality, but worth drinking."

As my grown kids' former teen peers might have said, this had better be, 'like, you know, like, the best tea evaaaaarrrr' to justify that outlay. It ain't. But don't despair. I bet you won't regret drinking it if you can find it at a steep (pun intended) discount. Brewed best a bit longer than usual recommended times-try 5 minutes-this is a rich, almost savory black tea, with well-balanced, thick smoothness to it, and a nice, strong flavor that doesn't go overboard with any particular element (bitterness, astringency, etc.). The pyramidal sachets swell up nicely after steeping too, with noticeably more (and better) aroma than the rather bland dry-bag sniff test. This indicates that Harney doesn't skimp on quantity at all, and chooses a very good tea blend for this product. I'll be sad when this tin is done...not just because I'll never again get a reasonably high-quality black tea for less than a penny per bag, but because it's actually good enough to be worth somewhere about halfway between what I paid and the retail cost. This is a perfectly nice, reasonably priced English breakfast tea, offered at a good price too. The Assam and Ceylon teas blend together well, and create a mellow flavor with a dash of butterscotch. I had this with plant milk; English breakfast teas are meant to be served with a little milk.  One-litre pot at home, made from a mixture of leaves of various broken black teas. Pours clear dark brown (against white china) with no sediment. Clear aroma of leaves, with malty and slightly spicy touches. Bitter, leafy and malty flavour of black tea, most probably including some varieties of Assam and Ceylon. Astringent palate with a malty and leafy aftertaste and spicy touches. A reasonable blend of its type, although nothing really special. Fair price ((euros)4.30 per 100 g), but not very cost efficient per cup. 7 3 3 69 14 g / l; 100 C; 4 min. Review #242  Not great, but decent and tolerable: that's how I'll characterize this blend. In my relatively limited experience, many food-service black teas (including English Breakfasts) taste rather flat, hollow, sometimes excessively bitter, or often weak, as if they've either been allowed to sit out in the open for 20 years, or dug out of the dregs of some automated processing machine and sold to the lowest bidder. Almost all have feeble dry-bag aroma. So does this one, but that's where the 'Here we go again!' sentiment got cut short. While not the richest or most robust food-service all-black tea (Farmer Brothers still takes that crown for me), Rituals darkened up quickly and presented a pleasant drinking experience with the added identity of a smooth finish and clean aftertaste. It's a basic tea without much in the way of side flavors or undertones I could detect, but still nice to drink on two cool mornings: once at the vacation home in New Hampshire where it was provided, and once after returning home to my well water. Quantity wasn't sacrificed either, with the wet bag being duly swollen, and mildly aromatic of a somewhat above-average bagged black tea, especially for a food-service product. Odds are you'll do worse with most such teas, so when you find this one, you've got a true fighting chance to enjoy it instead of just get some caffeine poured down your gullet. When first opening the tin, the tea smells earthy and dusty, very much like an inexpensive Yunnan black tea. The leaves are quite large for loose leaf tea at this price, but there are more than a few twig fragments among the leaves. This also matches my experience with inexpensive Yunnan black tea. While brewing, the aroma is consistent with my initial impression. Earthy, faint cocoa, oak leaves. The tea has a nice flavor, but it's light and the tea is thin-bodied. There's an unexpected bitterness and raisin maltiness, cut with an oaky and tannic astringency. It flavor profile reminds me a bit of TATA Gold, which is a blend of Assam CTC and Darjeeling leaves, but without the strength. I keep wanting there to be more to this tea. It's not bad, it just tastes like a blend of cheap teas that is, if anything, less than the sum of its parts. The flavor and body are light enough that I have to struggle a bit to properly taste them. The finish is a nice cocoa, but also fleeting. I paid $7 for a 100g/3.5oz tin that is $11.00 from The Tao of Tea's online shop. $2/ounce isn't outrageous, but there are less expensive teas that I enjoy more, including straight CTC Assam or Yunnan black teas. I'd feel ripped off if I'd paid $3/ounce. I won't be buying more. EDIT: I intentionally oversteeped the tea (fifteen minutes) and it improved a lot. It balances a bit too bitter, but the cocoa shines through with some dried cherries, classic malt, and a hint of molasses. Maybe that's what they were going for. If I were blind-tasting the oversteeped tea, I'd guess it to be an average Sri Lankan tea. In any case, I bumped the rating a few points. It's still overpriced for the quality, but worth drinking."

According to the Harney and Sons Guide to Tea, Golden Monkey is made from the da bai or 'big white' varietal of the tea plant, one typically used for white tea.[1] Canton Tea Co, however, reports that this type of tea is from the Xiao Cai cultivar. The tea is made from one leaf and a bud, in contrast to the standard plucking of the top two leaves and a bud. The harvest is timed to allow the buds to grow as large as possible while still remaining tender[1]. This tea tends to have a sweeter flavor and lower astringency than most black teas, owning to its lower tannin content. Its aroma is typically fruity, with tones of cocoa. The fruitiness is often compared to peach, apple, or dried fruit such as raisins. Although it is a black tea, the tips in its dry leaf have a golden color, hence the name. The name may also originate from a golden rim around the liquor in the brewed cup.[2] Golden monkey tends to be more expensive than a typical black tea due to its high concentration of tips or leaf buds. It is also tends to have more caffeine than other similar black teas, as the tips are higher in caffeine. According to James Norwood Pratt, this tea originated in Tanyang (Panyong) village in the Minbei region, and was developed for export to Europe.[2] Sometimes this type of tea is marketed as Panyong congou or Panyong wang, referencing its town of origin. These Panyong teas however are a broader category, also including teas that do not have as much golden tip. We classify teas in the panyang congou category if they are not marketed as golden monkey, or if they are teas from this region in this style that do not have a golden color and/or consist mostly of tips. Golden monkey is distinct from golden needle tea, a black tea made exclusively of buds, and is also distinct from Yunnan gold, a similar tea from Yunnan province. Yunnan gold shares some qualities in common with Golden monkey, but has a distinct aroma and flavor, and is often described as having a peppery quality. Sometimes companies market teas from Yunnan province as Golden Monkey, usually without providing any information as to style or varietal; in the absence of any further information, we usually list these teas as Golden Monkey, but they may be mis-labelled Yunnan Golds. Uncommonly, the term 'golden monkey' is also applied high grades of Keemun that is rich in golden tips and has a similar appearance. ",

                "Ordered a Fujiian Black Tea sampler pack from Yunnan Sourcing and this was my second favorite. Nice and light with a good 2-3 re-steeps coming out of it. The rest of the sampler were richer more malty and coffee like tea's while this one was the lightest. Not a roasted or rich flavor but something easy to drink.

                "This was the first tea I bought from Yunnan Sourcing that was not actually grown in Yunnan province. I was a bit reluctant to order it, but also curious, because this company has been so consistently good at everything they sell, both in terms of price and quality. This tea turned out to be a little less interesting than their other offerings, but just as enjoyable. Dry leaf is really intensely malty, with a faint hint of dried fruit, and mild toasty notes. The smell is rich and suggests a warming tea that would be good for cold mornings. It was funny trying this alongside all the Yunnan teas; the leaf is so incredibly fine, taking up much less space per weight. It's beautiful too, intensely curly and wiry, with a mix of bright orange and darker colors. The photos on Yunnan Sourcing's website capture EXACTLY what it looks like, and this is something I love about this company; their presentation of the teas is consistently honest. Produces a cup that is really rich and thick, but smooth. The cup is not as aromatic as I expected from the leaf: it's mild, only weakly malty, but there are more dried fruit notes, and it's almost a little nutty. There are also hints of crayons, and a sort of muted burned note. Flavor is mild, quite sweet, only faintly bitter, but also savory. There is a moderate astringency that appears mid-sip but diminishes by the end, leaving this tea to feel full-bodied but soft. So warming, it's like snuggling up in a blanket. Easy to brew, and easy to drink. This tea was forgiving both of leaf quantity and steep time. Brewed mildly, the sweetness comes out more and the cup tastes as if it had been sweetened with honey, although it can get a little syrupy. Brewed stronger, the tea is more full-bodied but never harsh. I like how I feel after drinking this one. It's not a wake-you-up tea, and didn't feel very caffeinated, but it felt very calming. My only possible complaint about this tea is that it was a little boring, especially alongside all the other teas from Yunnan. Yunnan teas are weird and different, and I like that; each one tastes unique. This tea was subdued and refined. It was a little bit like a good German beer amongst a bunch of good American micro-brews. Very reasonable price though. The only tea of this type that I thought was better, also cost a lot more. This tea was cheaper than a lot of teas that I thought were not as good!",
                "An excellent tea, with good balance between the flavors and aromas. A bit on the pricey side.",
                "This tea was more pleasant than interesting. I liked it a lot, but found it hard to write as much about it. I also thought it was slightly overpriced. Dry leaf is very pretty (like many of Murchie's teas, their photo doesn't do it justice, so I took one of my own), with bright golden-orange tips against a dark background, and a slightly curved, wiry shape to the leaf. It has an incredibly strong malty smell, this is among the maltiest of teas I've ever tried. The brewed cup is also very malty, most like rye malt, and only a few hints of others notes, including cocoa and a hint of vanilla. Overall though the aroma is more strong than it is complex. The flavor and mouthfeel are soft and rich. Flavor is very sweet, lightly savory, and with very little bitterness. Astringent towards the beginning of the sip, but this clears, leaving a clean finish. If brewed more strongly, a light bitterness comes out, and the astringency begins earlier in the sip, but this tea is still smooth and mild. I preferred drinking this tea on its own, not with food, due to its natural sweetness and rich, full character. It is so satisfying, it might be a good tea to drink an hour or so before a meal to stave off hunger without eating anything. Resteeped well. If you want a mellower cup you could easily get three steeps out of this, although they might be a bit boring. I preferred only two, using longer steeps to make each cup stronger and bring out the characteristics I liked. This struck me as a high-quality tea, but the price seems high, even with the exchange rate what it is these days (a good time to buy from Canadian companies). I've been buying more from Yunnan Sourcing recently, and there are comparable-quality or even better teas of similar styles, for half the price.",

These could be (are?) used in tea bags too. However, the fine chopping of the leaves, and the use of a high-tannin tea in the blend, probably are why the tea gets quite dark in-cup, quickly (less than 30 seconds).

The combination is what I've come to realize is typical of Kenyan or Rwandan tea and indicative of a crisp bitterness. The liquor quickly takes on the deep red-brown characteristic of blends popular in Ireland and the UK. I brewed four minutes in boiling water. The first taste is, indeed bitter, but not overpoweringly so or unpleasant. The flavor is strongly reminiscent of hops. It's less malty than I expected and moderately astringent. It's bold without being heavy. I like it, but prefer maltier tea. Once the tea starts to cool, it becomes more complex. There's still not much of a maltiness, but the bitterness takes on a woody character, like gentian or cherry bark, in a way that reminds me of cocktail bitters. I'm also beginning to get cocoa notes. I can imagine that milk or cream and sugar would transform this into a caramel-like flavor and I'm guessing that's the profile that they're going for. As I'm drinking it straight, though, it's definitely a bright and bracing sipping tea. I still keep looking for malt that just isn't there, though. With the $3 regular price and 20(percent) off that the site routinely offers, I paid about $2.40 for 40 tea bags, which is very close to Barry's suggested retail. At that price, it's definitely an excellent value. ",
                "This tea was spot-on in terms of style for Irish Breakfast, and one of the better examples of it at that. The leaf is broken but the pieces of leaf are still recognizable as such, especially after steeping. The dry leaf has a pleasant aroma that suggests a strong, fresh tea. It infuses fairly quickly to produce a potent cup. The brewed cup is strong and dark, and balanced in flavor, with just the right amount of bitterness. It is flirting with being harsh but I found it still okay to drink without milk. I find it interesting that Sylvia noted that it smells like beets; I wouldn't have noticed that myself, but now that she's said it, I do notice it too. Besides that though, it's typical for an Irish Breakfast: malty and with a typical black tea aroma, a slight toastiness or burned quality but no smokiness. Pleasant and more cooling than warming but balanced in this respect. Resteeps better than I had expected it to, given the broken nature of the leaf. I was able to get two good steeps out of it but after that the leaves were spent. Price is pretty good, even without considering the fair trade and organic certification. Definitely one of the better Irish Breakfast blends I've tried, as well as one of the better teas sold by Frontier.",

It's bold without being heavy. I like it, but prefer maltier tea. Once the tea starts to cool, it becomes more complex. There's still not much of a maltiness, but the bitterness takes on a woody character, like gentian or cherry bark, in a way that reminds me of cocktail bitters. I'm also beginning to get cocoa notes. I can imagine that milk or cream and sugar would transform this into a caramel-like flavor and I'm guessing that's the profile that they're going for. As I'm drinking it straight, though, it's definitely a bright and bracing sipping tea. I still keep looking for malt that just isn't there, though. With the $3 regular price and 20(percent) off that the site routinely offers, I paid about $2.40 for 40 tea bags, which is very close to Barry's suggested retail. At that price, it's definitely an excellent value.  This tea was spot-on in terms of style for Irish Breakfast, and one of the better examples of it at that. The leaf is broken but the pieces of leaf are still recognizable as such, especially after steeping. The dry leaf has a pleasant aroma that suggests a strong, fresh tea. It infuses fairly quickly to produce a potent cup. The brewed cup is strong and dark, and balanced in flavor, with just the right amount of bitterness. It is flirting with being harsh but I found it still okay to drink without milk. I find it interesting that Sylvia noted that it smells like beets; I wouldn't have noticed that myself, but now that she's said it, I do notice it too. Besides that though, it's typical for an Irish Breakfast: malty and with a typical black tea aroma, a slight toastiness or burned quality but no smokiness. Pleasant and more cooling than warming but balanced in this respect. Resteeps better than I had expected it to, given the broken nature of the leaf. I was able to get two good steeps out of it but after that the leaves were spent. Price is pretty good, even without considering the fair trade and organic certification. Definitely one of the better Irish Breakfast blends I've tried, as well as one of the better teas sold by Frontier. Prep: 8oz, sample packet, 212F, 5min This is my first Irish breakfast tea (at least by the specific tea). This was a free sample in my most recent adagio box. Aroma: I've had a few black teas from Adagio that were quite aggressive in their aromas. This is much more subtle; however, it's very inviting. Reminds me of a nice cup of coffee in that it's warming and inviting. 7/10 Taste: This is a nicely balanced and fairly malty tea. I'd go as far as to say this has some toasty and toasty character like a light stout. Very nice. 7/10 Body: This is fairly viscous. 8/10 Value: 1.50 per ounce makes this very cost effective. I usually do matcha first thing but I could see this being in my rotation. 9/10 Overall: For my first introduction to this style, I'm a fan. I think this will be a rebuy from me. 8/10"

This was a pleasant surprise: an exceptionally smooth tea, easy to brew and easy to drink, among the sweetest Keemuns I've tried. The dry leaf is very fine and curly, so much it is shaped more like Bi Luo Chun than like most Keemun Mao Feng I've seen before. It is subtly aromatic, not explosively so, but if you open the bag and breathe in there is a rich maltiness and a strong suggestion of sweetness. There is only a hint of the more typical burgundy notes and light smokiness I associate with most Keemun. Upon brewing, the aroma is very true to that of the dry leaf, just more potent. It is strong and extremely pleasing, suggesting of sweetness. Smells like pastries or other sweet baked goods, with a light maltiness, but there are also floral notes. Flavor is very sweet, with light savory notes and a mild, crisp bitterness. Very easy to drink, and has a pleasant warming effect. It resteeps well, and I find is also easy to brew: using more leaf or a longer steep makes it slightly stronger but it tastes good no matter how I make it. I found this tea to be most satisfying on cold days. It is quite warming relative to how subtle it is. This reminds me a lot of two now-discontinued Keemuns I've had in the past: the Keemun Mao Feng from Harney & Sons, and the Spring Keemun from Andrews & Dunham. All three are in the same style and the differences are subtle at best. This one I think is the best-priced, however, like most of Yunnan Sourcing's offerings, quite a steal for a tea of such quality. I highly recommend this one, but know that it is sweeter and mellower than a more typical or traditional Keemun.",

Clear aroma of black tea leaves, with malty touches. Bitterish flavour of black tea, with leafy and malty notes and touches of smoke.

It's similar, but recognizably different from the Hao Ya B, and I'm not convinced that I like it better. I like both, and this one is not that much more expensive (still reasonable for such a top-quality tea) that I wouldn't necessarily think of this one as a luxury splurge, so much as another option. Dry leaf not as aromatic as hao ya B. Smell is subtle, strongly suggests sweetness. It is vaguely nutty and chocolatey, with a hint of malt. It reminds me a little of hazelnut creme, marzipan, or nutella. When pouring water over the leaves, it also isn't that aromatic. Only when I remove the infuser (I used a basket infuser as I usually do) from the cup, and thus stirred the cup, did the aroma start to come out...and then it started smelling more like a keemun, faintly smoky, deeply fruity. Sipping though, I'm immediately struck by the strength and thickness of the cup. It's quite tannic, with a powerful astringency that starts right as the tea meets my tongue, and continues steadily through the sip till the end. This makes me want to sip it slowly, and as I do, the aroma develops. The aroma is much more malty as I drink it, than it was when just smelling the dry leaf or brewed cup. Definitely the maltiest keemun I've had, it reminds me of Yunnan teas and even a bit of Assam. The flavor is very rich too, not very bitter. The finish leaves a beautiful honey-like sweetness, complete with floral notes. It leaves a sensation in my mouth almost like I just licked a spoonful of honey. There are also vegetal notes in the finish. This tea also tastes good as it cools, which is good because I found its potency kept me from drinking it quickly enough to finish it while still hot. Resteeps very well, perhaps slightly better than the Hao Ya A. I recommend both this and the Hao Ya B from Harney, they're both exceptional and I think very fairly priced.",

It is even less smoky than its nearly as delicious sibling, Hao Ya 'B'. It has a very clean, crisp, fresh taste, very complex and sophisticated. This tea has a depth of character unlike any other tea I have tasted. This really is an excellent tea. It does not need cream or sugar to be fully appreciated, but I found that if you do use cream and sugar, both work better with this tea than either alone, but be cautious; you only need a very small amount of both to augment rather than overwhelm this tea's natural flavor, which just keeps getting better and better with every sip. Even the aftertaste is itself a unique and flavorful experience.

The sensation of each sip starts out oolong-like, leading into a richly astringent finish, more characteristic of a black tea. The finish leaves notes of bitter chocolate. This is a sipping tea, I can't drink it quickly, contrasting with some other complex teas where the subtlety can be lost if you drink it idly. The aroma is so busy and the sensations on the palate so multifaceted, and powerful, that it grabs my attention and forces me to slow down. The overall experience of drinking it is intensely warming, almost like drinking bourbon or other whiskey. As the cup cools, the aromatic character changes subtly. More malty notes come out, like rye. The cup tastes almost as good cooled when hot, although I think it is best when hot. Because of its intensity, I found it hard to finish the cup while still warm. Resteeps, and the second cup is good, but not mind-blowing like the first. The second cup retains the strong wine-like quality, and is deep.

                "I was surprised to find that I strongly preferred the slightly less expensive Keemun Grade 1 from TeaVivre to this offering. While this was a very good tea, it did not wow me as being outstanding, or even higher quality than a typical Keemun. It was just different. I was surprised at the strength of the cup, the darkness of the liquor, and the edginess present in the first cup. Much darker in color than most Keemun...more blackish than reddish. Second cup is much smoother. Both cups have a 'deep' sort of quality to them. Brewed western-style, the aroma has more of the cocoa-like tones, a lot like the Keemun Mao Feng I recently sampled from Life in Teacup, or like a Ceylon OPA. However, there is much less of the smokiness, and somewhat less of the woody qualities. Overall, this tea was more like a very high-end, large-leaf Ceylon than it was like other Keemuns. The price on this tea is also good. It is only slightly more expensive than the Grade 1 of the same brand. I would not think of this as a 'better' tea, merely a different one. For people who want a warmer, smoother tea, I'd recommend the grade 1. For people wanting a deeper, darker tea with a little more edge, this might be a better choice. I strongly prefer the grade 1 however. I tried this tea gongfu style. I was surprised by a more intense smokiness that came out in the first infusion. The second infusion was more balanced and more complex, but still smoky, and bearing an odd resemblance to shu Pu-erh. By the third infusion, this tea became a bit more normal, and was less interesting from this point on. The flavor gave out surprisingly quickly, with little flavor left after the third steeping. I actually settled on preferring to brew this tea western-style, in contrast to the grade 1 which I found really shined with gongfu-style brewing."

Well worth it as a once in a while treat, though! This tea has a mild flavor, but it's good. I added cream and sugar.  I was surprised to find that I strongly preferred the slightly less expensive Keemun Grade 1 from TeaVivre to this offering. While this was a very good tea, it did not wow me as being outstanding, or even higher quality than a typical Keemun. It was just different. I was surprised at the strength of the cup, the darkness of the liquor, and the edginess present in the first cup. Much darker in color than most Keemun...more blackish than reddish. Second cup is much smoother. Both cups have a 'deep' sort of quality to them. Brewed western-style, the aroma has more of the cocoa-like tones, a lot like the Keemun Mao Feng I recently sampled from Life in Teacup, or like a Ceylon OPA. However, there is much less of the smokiness, and somewhat less of the woody qualities. Overall, this tea was more like a very high-end, large-leaf Ceylon than it was like other Keemuns. The price on this tea is also good. It is only slightly more expensive than the Grade 1 of the same brand. I would not think of this as a 'better' tea, merely a different one. For people who want a warmer, smoother tea, I'd recommend the grade 1. For people wanting a deeper, darker tea with a little more edge, this might be a better choice. I strongly prefer the grade 1 however. I tried this tea gongfu style. I was surprised by a more intense smokiness that came out in the first infusion. The second infusion was more balanced and more complex, but still smoky, and bearing an odd resemblance to shu Pu-erh. By the third infusion, this tea became a bit more normal, and was less interesting from this point on. The flavor gave out surprisingly quickly, with little flavor left after the third steeping. I actually settled on preferring to brew this tea western-style, in contrast to the grade 1 which I found really shined with gongfu-style brewing."

                "I continue to branch out into black teas from provinces other than Yunnan, sold by Yunnan Sourcing. This was a pleasant surprise: an exceptionally smooth tea, easy to brew and easy to drink, among the sweetest Keemuns I've tried. The dry leaf is very fine and curly, so much it is shaped more like Bi Luo Chun than like most Keemun Mao Feng I've seen before. It is subtly aromatic, not explosively so, but if you open the bag and breathe in there is a rich maltiness and a strong suggestion of sweetness. There is only a hint of the more typical burgundy notes and light smokiness I associate with most Keemun. Upon brewing, the aroma is very true to that of the dry leaf, just more potent. It is strong and extremely pleasing, suggesting of sweetness. Smells like pastries or other sweet baked goods, with a light maltiness, but there are also floral notes. Flavor is very sweet, with light savory notes and a mild, crisp bitterness. Very easy to drink, and has a pleasant warming effect. It resteeps well, and I find is also easy to brew: using more leaf or a longer steep makes it slightly stronger but it tastes good no matter how I make it. I found this tea to be most satisfying on cold days. It is quite warming relative to how subtle it is. This reminds me a lot of two now-discontinued Keemuns I've had in the past: the Keemun Mao Feng from Harney & Sons, and the Spring Keemun from Andrews & Dunham. All three are in the same style and the differences are subtle at best. This one I think is the best-priced, however, like most of Yunnan Sourcing's offerings, quite a steal for a tea of such quality. I highly recommend this one, but know that it is sweeter and mellower than a more typical or traditional Keemun.",
                "Finally, a good Keemun! The dry tea has an aroma of aged wood, with a smoky scent that's more like the smokiness of a smoked cheese than the harsh smokiness of lower quality Keemun. I brewed it in a French press with water that hadn't reached boiling yet. The brewed tea has a similar aroma to the dry leaves, but this aroma doesn't even hint at the flavor. It has tangy tropical fruit and berry notes and a smooth and full mouthfeel; I now understand where all the talk of Keemun being 'winey' comes from. The fruity, juicy finish lingers forever (coincidentally reminding me of a red wine I sampled earlier in the day), without a hint of astringency, while a black pepper-like spiciness appears at the back of my throat. I've been really enjoying spicy tea lately, so that's a pleasant surprise. The second cup is substantially different, lacking the spiciness of the first and exchanging the berries for a rich dark chocolate flavor that blends well with the tart fruit notes. This cup is slightly more astringent than the first, but that only means that I actually noticed a small amount of astringency this time. It's still far less astringent than any Indian black tea I've ever had would be after a five minute steep. I bought this at a tea shop, not from Culinary Teas' website, so I'm judging its value by the price I paid. This being my first Keemun that I would consider to be good quality, I don't have much to compare it to, but I think it's a great tea that I'd happily buy again.",
                "I'm having a hard time rating this tea. It smelled pretty bad to me, like burnt pine. I guess that's the smokiness. The flavor was nicely earthy and slightly chocolaty with the occasional subtle fruit note. I enjoyed the flavor, but hated the aroma. I always knew it was done brewing and would taste the way I liked it when it smelled like someone forced a jigsaw through a board of old wood as quickly as possible.

Now, somehow, this tea managed to clear that all away and elicit only my positive memories of smoke -- clean, pine wood campfires in the woods, the lingering scent of smoke by a well-made fire. The smoke scent here is clean and tinged with pine. Some Lapsang Souchong teas I've smelled have a less-clean scent to them, as if the smoke which they were exposed to wasn't pure. Not so with this one. It elicits the memory of the outdoors because it's that pure in its scent. The flavor is similar for the first few cups, Eastern style. Then, the smoke fades to more pine and woody notes. The tea is relaxing, rather than energizing -- which is par for the course with smoked and roasted teas, as the caffeine just doesn't seem to endure the process. There was a bit of that light cough from smokiness. I never enjoy that aspect of smoky teas. But, the calming, extremely warming experience of drinking this was much-needed. It really warmed me more than an average tea -- perhaps because of the smokiness.

When brewed more strongly, there are some notes of bitter chocolate that I feel make this tea a lot more enjoyable, but it still doesn't really stand out.

This might be a good tea for late afternoon or early evening if you want something dark and rich without keeping you awake at night. Overall though I'd pass on this one, it didn't impress me. It was the combination of the weakness of the aroma, with the fact that it became bitter and astringent if brewed more strongly, that made me dislike it.

                "A wonderful, nuanced black tea with a mild flavor, and complex aroma, also creating nice sensations on the palate. Dry leaf has a mild but very pleasing aroma suggestive of sweet dried fruit, but fresher and lighter smelling. Upon brewing, this produces a very dark brown cup with a mellow aroma, yet exquisite flavor. The aroma is subtle and very pleasing: I agree with the description that claims hints of caramel and cocoa, and spiciness...there's a very faint hint of caraway and wintergreen as well. Upon drinking the whole cup, tones suggestive of banana, cinnamon, and nut come out. I find this tea's aroma tricky to describe: it's very complex and nuanced. The flavor is very pleasing, naturally sweet with a slight bitterness and noticeable savory (umami) quality. It's the sensations on the palate though that I think really make this tea...it has a moderately astringent body, giving it a sort of dry feeling, but this fades into leaving a tingling sensation on the tongue. Has a much more cooling quality than usual for Chinese teas. I really liked this one. I was able to brew a second cup off the same set of leaves, but it required a long steeping and was less flavorful than the first...this tea didn't do quite as well with multiple steepings as some high-grade Chinese black teas do. That said I still thought this tea was top notch. It is not cheap, but I thought the price was reasonable for a tea of this quality. I found the pricing a bit odd; the 50g size is a better deal than the sample or 25g size but the 75g size isn't any cheaper, and 5 grams for a sample seems a little on the small size--I like 15 gram or so samples and I sometimes even think of 25 grams as a sample."

It was the combination of the weakness of the aroma, with the fact that it became bitter and astringent if brewed more strongly, that made me dislike it. I did find there were some subtleties in the aroma when I used a lot of leaf and a long steep, but this made the cup too harsh for my tastes. I like this tea. It has a weird kind of aroma, but it's good overall. The flavor is strong, crisp, and not too bitter. I added cream and sugar. It's interesting that on the package it recommends adding cream and not milk, because I always add cream to my tea.  A wonderful, nuanced black tea with a mild flavor, and complex aroma, also creating nice sensations on the palate. Dry leaf has a mild but very pleasing aroma suggestive of sweet dried fruit, but fresher and lighter smelling. Upon brewing, this produces a very dark brown cup with a mellow aroma, yet exquisite flavor. The aroma is subtle and very pleasing: I agree with the description that claims hints of caramel and cocoa, and spiciness...there's a very faint hint of caraway and wintergreen as well. Upon drinking the whole cup, tones suggestive of banana, cinnamon, and nut come out. I find this tea's aroma tricky to describe: it's very complex and nuanced. The flavor is very pleasing, naturally sweet with a slight bitterness and noticeable savory (umami) quality. It's the sensations on the palate though that I think really make this tea...it has a moderately astringent body, giving it a sort of dry feeling, but this fades into leaving a tingling sensation on the tongue. Has a much more cooling quality than usual for Chinese teas. I really liked this one. I was able to brew a second cup off the same set of leaves, but it required a long steeping and was less flavorful than the first...this tea didn't do quite as well with multiple steepings as some high-grade Chinese black teas do. That said I still thought this tea was top notch. It is not cheap, but I thought the price was reasonable for a tea of this quality. I found the pricing a bit odd; the 50g size is a better deal than the sample or 25g size but the 75g size isn't any cheaper, and 5 grams for a sample seems a little on the small size--I like 15 gram or so samples and I sometimes even think of 25 grams as a sample."

The name refers to a style of tea that was transported by caravan from China through Mongolia and into Russia, starting in the late 1600's.[1] The other types of black tea used in the blend are virtually endless, and commonly include such teas as Assam, Keemun, or Darjeeling. Russian caravan sometimes contains oolong tea as well; because most modern blends do not contain oolong, and because the oolong tends to be of a darker character and does not appreciably change this tea from having a black-tea-like character, we have chosen to list this blend as a style of black tea. Lapsang souchong imparts a smoky aroma to the tea, and the resulting blend is usually quite smoky. Typically the other teas used in the blend have a stronger quality than the Lapsang souchong, which tends to be a mellow, smooth tea with a low caffeine content. The resulting blends typically are more caffeinated, more bitter, and less smoky than Lapsang souchong on its own. Because both Lapsang souchong and the other black teas used to create the Russian caravan blend come in many different grades and qualities, Russian caravan itself comes in many different grades and has widely variable quality.

While it doesn't have as much of that lovely flavour profile of a LS, it's a traditional Russian Caravan style blend that both smells lovely (like a LS, but mulled with more traditional black tea scents) and has a taste to match.

I wonder if this blend includes a dark Formosa oolong in the mix, or if it's just an oolong-like black tea? Only very lightly smoky; I've had much smokier Russian Caravan blends that are still not too much for me. Very full-bodied. Low bitterness, but a lot of astringency, especially in the finish. Very warming. I thought this tea was overpriced relative to how much I enjoyed it, which I found surprising because Upton usually impresses me with their prices.

The Chinese name 'gong fu' means 'great skill', reflecting the skill that goes into the production of this tea. Yunnan gold is a tippy tea, meaning that it is high in leaf buds, and is named for the fact that its leaves are golden in color. The large portion of buds give it a higher caffeine content. The degree of golden color varies as a function of the amount of tips, as well as the production process: teas with a more golden appearance tend to have a greater portion of tips, and thus a higher caffeine content. Most Yunnan gold looks more or less like a black tea with numerous gold tips interspersed, but ones made exclusively of tips can be mostly golden. These teas are called Yunnan pure gold or dianhong jinya, or less commonly, jinya dianhong. The most tippy Yunnan gold teas are similar in appearance to golden monkey, another tippy black tea that has a golden color; golden monkey is produced in Yunnan province but also in Fujian.",

                "I tried this tea right when I ordered it, but did not like it. It had few objectionable qualities, and was actually quite smooth, but simply seemed a little boring. However, I set it in my cupboard for quite some time and sure enough, it has started tasting more interesting after about a year and a half. Still, it is not my favorite and I thought it was expensive relative to how much I enjoyed it. The dry leaf has a rather different aroma from most of the Yunnan red teas I've tried. The smell reminds me a lot of the larger-leaf Assam teas I ordered from TeaOrb a while back. There is more of a fermented (and I mean fermented, not oxidized) smell, a sort of smell reminiscent of decaying autumn leaves, with some deep fruity and herbaceous notes. The brewed cup is very interesting. The flavor is exceptionally smooth, in my opinion, too much so. I prefer teas to have a bit more body. However the smoothness allows you to brew this tea more strongly, to bring out more complexity in the flavor. The flavor is quite sweet, and lightly savory/umami, but there is little bitterness or sourness. At times the cup reminds me of some Japanese green teas, flavor-wise. The aroma has a lot going on, but is subtle. Fleeting notes appear, vanish, then reappear. Notes include a nice floral honey, autumn leaves (less than from the smell of the dry leaf), and fruitiness but it's hard to pin down on a specific fruit. The fruitiness of the brewed cup is more like fresh fruit, contrasting with the dry leaf which suggested dried fruit. One thing that was interesting to me about aging is that I found after letting this tea sit for about a year and a half, the floral notes seemed stronger, which surprised me, as those notes are often not the type that stick around in a tea's aroma as you age it. The tea resteeps well. Some aromatic notes come out in the resteeps that were not present initially, such as cinnamon notes or notes of wood, faintly smoky. Some of the subsequent steeps can have a more oolong-like character. However I think it may be exaggerating to say this can be steeped 8+ times gong fu style. Perhaps this tea just wasn't suited for my tastes, but I found because it was too smooth and lacked the bitterness that I often seek out in tea, I found it gave out much earlier than that. But I also thought that all steeps were somehow unsatisfying to me, no matter how I brewed it. This tea was interesting, and I can recognize that quality craftsmanship went into its production, but in the end I did not enjoy it as much as the robust Yunnan teas. Some of them had at least as much aromatic complexity, but more body and flavour. I also thought it was quite pricey. Some of my favorite teas from Yunnan Sourcing cost little more than half as much as this one, yet I enjoy them much more. So, for someone with my taste, I thought this was overpriced. Someone who likes very smooth, sweet, mellow teas and dislikes bitterness and astrigency might enjoy this one more.",

The Chinese name 'gong fu' means 'great skill', reflecting the skill that goes into the production of this tea. Yunnan gold is a tippy tea, meaning that it is high in leaf buds, and is named for the fact that its leaves are golden in color. The large portion of buds give it a higher caffeine content. The degree of golden color varies as a function of the amount of tips, as well as the production process: teas with a more golden appearance tend to have a greater portion of tips, and thus a higher caffeine content. Most Yunnan gold looks more or less like a black tea with numerous gold tips interspersed, but ones made exclusively of tips can be mostly golden. These teas are called Yunnan pure gold or dianhong jinya, or less commonly, jinya dianhong. The most tippy Yunnan gold teas are similar in appearance to golden monkey, another tippy black tea that has a golden color; golden monkey is produced in Yunnan province but also in Fujian.Spring 2022.

            "about": "Green tea is a type of tea that has been processed to stop oxidization (contrasting with black and oolong teas). The oxidation is halted by heating, usually by steaming, pan-firing or baking, which destroys the enzymes that lead to oxidation, thus preserving the green color of the tea leaf. White tea is less processed than green tea, but tends to be more oxidized, and can have a darker leaf color. This same process also preserves the vitamin C content of the tea leaf, making green tea the only type of tea with appreciable vitamin C levels. Green tea is widely consumed in East Asia, especially in China, and in Japan, where nearly all tea consumed is green tea. China and Japan are the origins of most varieties of green tea. With a few exceptions, the rest of the world consumed little green tea until recently. Interest in green tea is surging due both to its purported health benefits and increasing interest in loose-leaf artisan teas. Green tea is produced in many different regions, but the main two traditions of green tea production are Chinese and Japanese. China tends to produce pan-fired green teas, whereas Japan tends to produce steamed varieties, although there are exceptions to both these rules, like kamairicha. Virtually every region that produces tea produces some green tea, although outside of southeast Asia, green tea constitutes only a small but increasing portion of total production. Because of its diversity, the flavor and aroma of green teas are difficult to describe in general terms. Many green teas have a more vegetal aroma, with grassy or herbaceous tones. Some of the pan-fired green teas have a smoky aroma, and some steamed teas have an aroma suggestive of seaweed. In contrast to black tea, which usually tastes best when brewed with boiling water, many green teas taste best when brewed with water substantially below the boiling point, ranging from 160-180F (71-82C). Our pages about brewing temperature for tea and brewing tea go into more depth on this topic. Many websites and other sources claim that green tea has less caffeine than black tea. This is not necessarily true; the caffeine content of teas varies widely both between different types of green tea and between different types of black tea. Both green and black tea can be higher or lower in caffeine. The processes involved in the production of green tea have also recently been extended to herbal teas--teas made out of plants other than the tea plant. Examples are green rooibos and honeybush. Green yerba mat\u00e9, however, is not produced similarly to green tea--that term refers simply to the unroasted form. ",

It is grown at a high altitude from a special cultivar of tea plant, called bai ye yi hao, which means 'white leaf number one'. Because of its Chinese name, Anji bai cha is sometimes called a 'white tea', but, classified by its production process, it is a green tea, not a white tea. The term white refers to the whitish color of the leaves, and the pale color of the brewed tea. Like gyokuro, this tea is best brewed with a lower temperature of water even relative to other green teas. Also like gyokuro, this tea has a high amino acid content giving it a bit of an 'umami' flavor. In contrast to the shade-grown and chlorophyll-rich gyokuro, this tea has less chlorophyll in the leaves relative to other green teas, giving it a lighter appearance. Anji bai cha and gyokuro are two teas highest in L-theanine, an essential amino acid that has been implicated in relaxation and improved concentration; one source reported that both of these teas contain about 2(percent) theanine by dry weight.[4] ",

                "I have read about Anji Baicha for years now, and this is the first time I've ever tried it. I've been very curious about it, especially since I've read that it's among the teas highest in L-theanine, but is prepared rather differently from Gyokuro, the tea I've tried that is also highest in theanine. It didn't quite wow me, but I liked it. I do see a slight resemblance to Gyokuro, but overall I found it more like other Chinese teas, and much easier to appreciate and enjoy. Dry leaf smells beautiful, fresh, grassy, and toasty, with notes of grain or bread. The smell suggests a sweet and savory flavor. As leaves hit the water the smell shifts and smells less sweet, and there's a surprisingly strong minty or wintergreen note. The aroma is also a little soapy, but this quality vanishes as I drink it, and is never unpleasant. The tea liquor is incredibly light, almost colorless unless you pour it in a pristine white cup. Flavor is mild, surprisingly sweet, and lightly savory. Yet, in spite of the light color, the tea is surprisingly full-bodied, with a pleasant astringency. Resteeps very well. I suspect you could get three steeps, especially if you kept the first one short (1-2 min?), but I preferred two with longer steeps. I was told to be cautious on brewing temperature, making sure it's quite low, but as an experiment I did edge the brewing temperature up a little, and outside of a slightly metallic taste, the tea tasted perfectly drinkable. It was definitely better with lower temperature water though. Overall, this tea was much more forgiving than Gyokuro, which I think would make me prefer it. I liked how I felt after drinking this. It is incredibly mild and I noticed no noticeable caffeine kick, but I found it relaxing and helped me focus more. Is it worth the price? I don't know. This is a super high-end tea, $33 for two ounces, $5 for just enough for 3 cups. I'm glad I tried it, but I think it's out of my price range, and I didn't enjoy it enough to justify spending this kind of money.",
                "(Update) The previous review I did may not have been completely fair to this tea. I brewed it slightly different this time, using a little more leaf, a little less water, and just under 3 minutes for the steep. It's a great tea actually! Very light in color, aromatic, velvety smooth, and clean/pure in flavor. It's kind of like a dragonwell but without the vegetal tones. I think the vegetal taste I got before might have been from oversteeping. It's more like a buttery sort of taste that is straight-forward but great in its own right. Major downside is the price, but it is grown organically in a remote region. (Old Review) This was a subtle tea compared to the others I tried from Life in Teacup. Subtle does not mean bad, however. The same level of overall quality was there, it was just a milder tea than I normally prefer, The aroma was very light, but had the character of a quality Chinese green tea. Tiny hairs from the tea leaves floated on the surface of the liquid. the color was like a shiny gold coin. The taste is light and refreshing, with some vegetal quality and a slight savoriness. Overall a very clean-tasting and drinkable tea. I can't wait until my palate can better distinguish the subtleties of good tea like this.",
                "The aroma is very delicate and very fresh, a mellow blend of fruit like sweetness and roasted chestnuts. Of course there is a vegetal presence, it is one of green beans and fresh vegetation, there is also a delicate hint of flowers at the finish. This tea smells wonderful, it has my favorite aspects of a delicate Chinese green tea, smelling like late spring and rain. The first steep starts out with a delicate creamy mouthfeel, this is one of those teas that really fills the mouth up with each taste. And what a taste it is! Delicate vegetal notes of green beans and lima beans with a finish of sweet chestnuts. The taste is incredibly delicate and subtle but incredibly nuanced. I was able to get several steeps and experiment with a new brewing style with this tea. Every part of the experience was wonderful.",

I'm glad I tried it, but I think it's out of my price range, and I didn't enjoy it enough to justify spending this kind of money. (Update) The previous review I did may not have been completely fair to this tea. I brewed it slightly different this time, using a little more leaf, a little less water, and just under 3 minutes for the steep. It's a great tea actually! Very light in color, aromatic, velvety smooth, and clean/pure in flavor. It's kind of like a dragonwell but without the vegetal tones. I think the vegetal taste I got before might have been from oversteeping. It's more like a buttery sort of taste that is straight-forward but great in its own right. Major downside is the price, but it is grown organically in a remote region. (Old Review) This was a subtle tea compared to the others I tried from Life in Teacup. Subtle does not mean bad, however. The same level of overall quality was there, it was just a milder tea than I normally prefer, The aroma was very light, but had the character of a quality Chinese green tea. Tiny hairs from the tea leaves floated on the surface of the liquid. the color was like a shiny gold coin. The taste is light and refreshing, with some vegetal quality and a slight savoriness. Overall a very clean-tasting and drinkable tea. I can't wait until my palate can better distinguish the subtleties of good tea like this. The aroma is very delicate and very fresh, a mellow blend of fruit like sweetness and roasted chestnuts. Of course there is a vegetal presence, it is one of green beans and fresh vegetation, there is also a delicate hint of flowers at the finish. This tea smells wonderful, it has my favorite aspects of a delicate Chinese green tea, smelling like late spring and rain. The first steep starts out with a delicate creamy mouthfeel, this is one of those teas that really fills the mouth up with each taste. And what a taste it is! Delicate vegetal notes of green beans and lima beans with a finish of sweet chestnuts. The taste is incredibly delicate and subtle but incredibly nuanced. I was able to get several steeps and experiment with a new brewing style with this tea. Every part of the experience was wonderful. What a delightful and relaxing tea. "

Normally, in the production of most Japanese green tea, the leaf stem, hairs, major leaf veins, and other coarser parts of the leaf are removed in a sorting process; in aracha these are kept mixed together and all parts are used. Aracha is usually finished in a production process similar to sencha, and these teas can be considered to be both aracha and sencha. The quality of aracha can vary widely, in large part due to variations in handling and processing technique during harvesting. In general, batches containing larger, less broken pieces of leaf are considered higher quality, and they tend to store better and produce teas that are less bitter. The different components of the tea leaf in aracha can contribute different aromatic and flavor qualities that can lead to a more complex cup than sorted teas. The stems are often lower in bitterness and impart more body to a cup, and, when combined with the other components of the leaf, can produce a more balanced cup. Whether aracha is better or worse than sorted teas is often a matter of personal taste. Aracha often performs poorly at the stricter traditional Japanese measures of evaluating teas, because of the heterogeneous color of the leaf, but it can often outperform other teas when judged by qualities of the brewed cup alone.",

                "I purchased this at a Cantonese grocery store in Edison, NJ. I really liked this. It is a high-end Japanese tea, but is unsorted, meaning that it also contains larger pieces of leaf and stem, something that is often missing from the higher-quality teas. As such I find it has a bolder flavor and more complex aroma. For brewing a single cup, I found I preferred one teaspoon of leaf or slightly less per cup, and brewing 1 minute, using water in the 160-180(degrees)F temperature range. Resteeps well and you can easily get 2 cups, possibly more from one set of leaves, even using that little leaf. Flavor is fairly bold: there is a strong savory flavor, and a moderate, but pleasant bitterness. Little sourness. Cup is moderately astringent, and the combination of the savory flavor and moderate astringency makes this full-bodied and thick. Aroma is strongly seaweedy and vegetal, a little toasty, with hints of grain. I love how this tea smells. This also makes an exceptional iced tea. To make it iced, I like to use 3 teaspoons of leaf and steep for about 12 minutes to make about 4 cups worth. This makes a pretty strong iced tea; you could use less if you want something milder. I liked this tea overall. I found it slightly more forgiving on brewing than other high-end teas, stronger, and more aromatically complex. I'm not sure if everyone would like this though, it's definitely more suited to people who like bold flavors and vegetal aromas. My only complaint is that this is a bit on the pricey side, especially if you buy the smaller (100g) size. It's good, but at this price it is competing with some of the better artisan teas out there. I have found a number of teas that I like equally wth this (although not exactly the same, just different teas that I enjoy about the same amount) that are a good bit cheaper. That said, the price is moderated by the fact that the leaf stretches very far, and if you buy the 200g size online the price seems more reasonable than what I paid for it in the retail grocery. Bottom line, this is good stuff, and if you like strong-tasting Japanese green teas, I recommend it!"

The leaf smell is a bit harsh in the way raw Pu-erh that has not been aged can be, and I'm not sure how I like it. The brewed cup initially has an aroma that doesn't smell much like food or drink to me...it smells a lot like a dank basement, old upholstery, old leather.

Like most of these Assam green teas, it is very astringent, and, unique to this tea, I found it had an unpleasant sourness as well. I tried brewing gently to minimize the astringency, being careful to keep the water temperature low. This brought out floral notes, but the tea was then too boring and weak for me. Brewed this way, I was able to drink it but it sank into the background and wasn't very satisfying. I was unable to settle on a way of brewing this tea that satisfied me. It was either too weak and thin, or too astringent, or in a weird middle zone. I will pass on this one. I'm hoping to find a Summer Assam green I actually like, but I'm starting to think I just don't like any of these teas. So far the only green teas I've really enjoyed from TEAORB have been from spring harvests, but I'm trying to keep an open mind.

Thank you to TEAORB for the samples, this is an interesting experience even if I don't like all the teas. Dry leaf smells heavy, pungent, vegetal, spicy, with a hint of camphor, a lot like some raw Pu-erhs that have not yet been aged. The aroma of the brewed cup is milder, mostly soapy and slightly floral and vegetal. Like many of these Assam greens, the mouthfeel is thick and quite astringent, and it tasted harsh when hot and was better when it had cooled somewhat. TEAORB describes this as having a 'mellow' palate, but I don't agree, although I agree with their description of the aroma as vegetal. I found this tea to be unpleasantly harsh when brewed strong enough for me to really appreciate its aroma. When I used less leaf and a shorter steep, the astringency was reduced to a manageable level, and the flavor was quite pleasant, but it was then aromatically quite flat. Slightly metallic finish, when brewed weakly. There are a few interesting notes, reminiscent of Chinese teas, especially Yunnan teas, but when I compare this to a sheng Pu-erh I just can't see buying this...there are so many teas that have a similar character, are cheaper, and are more pleasant to drink.",

This is the first summer-harvest Assam green tea, and I was curious to see if it tasted appreciably different from the others. I was disappointed that it tasted more-or-less similar, and I don't think I would be able to pick it out of the lineup as being harvested at a different time. TEAORB describes this tea as having a sweet aroma but strong flavor, and I agree. Dry leaf, which looks beautiful, is mild, but the aroma is slightly sweet. Unfortunately, none of this sweetness came through in the cup. The brewed cup has a soapy aroma, again, mild. As I sip it, it develops fresh herbaceous notes. At times it reminds me of greener oolongs. I very much like the aromatic profile, but it was very astringent, even if brewed mildly. I experimented brewing it progressively weaker, and when it was mild enough to drink, it was watery and aromatically weak. Experimenting with brewing temperature also had little positive effect. I would pass on this one; I found it hard to enjoy drinking.",

Many of the Assam greens I've tried have been bold, alien, and the sort of tea I would need to be in the right mood to drink, but this one was quite different...I'd describe it as an easy-drinking tea, especially for someone who likes Chinese green teas. Dry leaf has a grassy and toasty aroma, closer to Chinese green teas than any, a lot like a dragon well in particular. Cup is fresh and crisp tasting, more cooling and less warming than any of the other Assam greens so far. When brewed it reminded of a cross between dragon well and more inexpensive Chinese green teas like chun mee; it was cleaner tasting, but seemed to lack the depth that some of the other Assam green teas I've been trying from TEAORB have. This tea was easy to brew and retained a remarkably similar character regardless of how I brewed it. It seems to take near-boiling water just fine, but also tastes fine when brewed with lower-temperature water. Varying the leaf amount or steeping times just makes it stronger or weaker. Compare with the tea from Basundhara estate, that I just reviewed...this one is the same price, had a similar character, and I preferred it slightly on all counts."

For these reasons bancha is sometimes described as a coarse tea, and tends to have a lower caffeine content. Like most Japanese green teas, bancha is steamed rather than pan-fired as most Chinese green teas are. Bancha is a lower grade of tea than sencha, and tends to be less expensive. However, it is hard to generalize about the quality or price of bancha; some bancha exceeds some sencha in both price and quality. Bancha is sold plain, and is also frequently roasted to produce hojicha, and is also often combined with toasted brown rice to make genmaicha. Although bancha is ubiquitous in Japan, it is not as well-known in the west, possibly owing to the commercial focus on varieties of tea that are perceived as higher-quality. ",

The dry tea is bright green and broken into medium-small pieces. The initial aroma is strong and grassy. The directions say to use 3g of tea per 100ml, boiling water, and to steep for 30 seconds. I instead used 5g in a 16oz mug, 180(degrees)F water, and steeped for 3 minutes, which is how I brew other green tea. Brewing, the tea smells a lot like green tea in tea bags from US grocery stores and an initial taste backs this up. I'm actually surprised at how similar this is to brands like Bigelow or Lipton and I now strongly suspect that this grade of tea is a prominent part of many generic 'green tea' blends. The flavor is mild with only light bitterness and astringency. When hot, the tea is almost flavorless, but the flavor intensifies as it cools. It's very grassy. There are notes of slightly bitter garden vegetables (raw parsnip), but these are more noticeable in the finish as the slight bitterness seems to cling to the tongue. The flavor is better than the cheapest US green teas like Lipton, but only just. Overall, the tea's not bad, but definitely disappointing. I paid $6.99 at an Asian grocery store. The website says that the Japanese retail price is (yen)300, which is about a third of that. It's cheap tea and tastes like it, so I definitely wouldn't bother to pay the higher price as an import. UPDATE: Just for completeness, I tried this tea according to the package directions, which is 3g of tea per 120ml of boiling water for 30 seconds. That came to 12g for my 16oz. mug, which is just over twice the tea that I normally use (5g). It's tastier than I expected. I'ts still a bit dull, but there's more of the bright bitterness on the tongue that I associate with Japanese green tea along with some sweetness that I couldn't detect before. There's also a bit of the unpleasant bitterness and weediness that I associate with cheap tea bags. I'm not sure if that's tea quality, water that's too hot for green tea, or both. The tea's definitely better this way and it far outshines the grocery store tea bags to which I was comparing it before. I bumped the rating (from 38) to reflect this since, to be fair, Ujinotsuyu did tell me to make it like this. Of course, it's also twice as expensive this way for the same amount of beverage and is now a serious underperformer in that regard. I'm tempted to try this with grocery store tea bags to see how it affects the flavor.",
                "This came recommended by RT leader Alex as a good budget bancha. And the price was very reasonable, about as little as anyone could expect to pay for a decent tea. It has a pleasant, earthy aroma, but the flavor is a little insipid. I wasn't expecting perfection tho - this is a reliable everyday green tea.",
                "I have purchased this a number of times, and the quality varies from year to year. This 2018 batch is not the best, but it is still a pleasant green tea, with a light vegetal flavor. The price has steadily increased over the years. ",
                "This may be the best bancha I've ever tried. It's better than a number of lower-end sencha's I've bought in the U.S. The dry leaf is green for bancha and has the most delightful aroma, the best yet of any bancha I've tried. It smells a lot like coffee cake, a sort of sweet, baked good smell with hints of cinnamon, and there are a few vegetal or grassy notes. Flavor is sweet and slightly savory (umami) with a hint of tanginess and only a very slight bitterness. Overall the flavor is balanced and complex. The aroma is strongly of corn, reminiscent almost of bourbon, with light straw notes. Light astringency, just enough to impart body. Eminently pleasing. Not that caffeinated, I enjoyed drinking this in the late afternoon and was happily able to drink two cups of it without it it keeping me up later. I found this tasted best with a brief (1.5 min.) first steep. This minimizes the astringency but still yields a pleasantly flavorful and aromatic cup. I was then able to resteep it just five with a 5 minute or longer second steep. Unfortunately, this tea only seemed to resteep twice, there wasn't much flavor left in the leaves after that. I was careful with the water temperature; I'm not sure how this would fare with hotter water but I used water about 170-180F and it was good. Good price, especially given that it resteeps.",
                "This is truly an 'upgraded' Bancha, picked just after first flush from the larger, thicker base of the leaves. More astringent than sencha, but well balanced in flavor and aroma. I love the grassy flavor and feel it leaves in your mouth. Den's Bancha Suruga is wonderfully refreshing when brewed as per their instructions, and I have found it to be excellent when ice brewed, as well. It is produced in the Shizuoka province of Japan of the Yabukita cultivar/species which is hard to find since most 'Bancha' teas available in the US are actually from China. A nice tea to sip casually through out the day."

The website says that the Japanese retail price is (yen)300, which is about a third of that. It's cheap tea and tastes like it, so I definitely wouldn't bother to pay the higher price as an import. UPDATE: Just for completeness, I tried this tea according to the package directions, which is 3g of tea per 120ml of boiling water for 30 seconds. That came to 12g for my 16oz. mug, which is just over twice the tea that I normally use (5g). It's tastier than I expected. I'ts still a bit dull, but there's more of the bright bitterness on the tongue that I associate with Japanese green tea along with some sweetness that I couldn't detect before. There's also a bit of the unpleasant bitterness and weediness that I associate with cheap tea bags. I'm not sure if that's tea quality, water that's too hot for green tea, or both. The tea's definitely better this way and it far outshines the grocery store tea bags to which I was comparing it before. I bumped the rating (from 38) to reflect this since, to be fair, Ujinotsuyu did tell me to make it like this. Of course, it's also twice as expensive this way for the same amount of beverage and is now a serious underperformer in that regard. I'm tempted to try this with grocery store tea bags to see how it affects the flavor. This came recommended by RT leader Alex as a good budget bancha. And the price was very reasonable, about as little as anyone could expect to pay for a decent tea. It has a pleasant, earthy aroma, but the flavor is a little insipid. I wasn't expecting perfection tho - this is a reliable everyday green tea. I have purchased this a number of times, and the quality varies from year to year. This 2018 batch is not the best, but it is still a pleasant green tea, with a light vegetal flavor. The price has steadily increased over the years.  This may be the best bancha I've ever tried. It's better than a number of lower-end sencha's I've bought in the U.S. The dry leaf is green for bancha and has the most delightful aroma, the best yet of any bancha I've tried. It smells a lot like coffee cake, a sort of sweet, baked good smell with hints of cinnamon, and there are a few vegetal or grassy notes. Flavor is sweet and slightly savory (umami) with a hint of tanginess and only a very slight bitterness. Overall the flavor is balanced and complex. The aroma is strongly of corn, reminiscent almost of bourbon, with light straw notes. Light astringency, just enough to impart body. Eminently pleasing. Not that caffeinated, I enjoyed drinking this in the late afternoon and was happily able to drink two cups of it without it it keeping me up later. I found this tasted best with a brief (1.5 min.) first steep. This minimizes the astringency but still yields a pleasantly flavorful and aromatic cup. I was then able to resteep it just five with a 5 minute or longer second steep. Unfortunately, this tea only seemed to resteep twice, there wasn't much flavor left in the leaves after that. I was careful with the water temperature; I'm not sure how this would fare with hotter water but I used water about 170-180F and it was good. Good price, especially given that it resteeps. This is truly an 'upgraded' Bancha, picked just after first flush from the larger, thicker base of the leaves. More astringent than sencha, but well balanced in flavor and aroma. I love the grassy flavor and feel it leaves in your mouth. Den's Bancha Suruga is wonderfully refreshing when brewed as per their instructions, and I have found it to be excellent when ice brewed, as well. It is produced in the Shizuoka province of Japan of the Yabukita cultivar/species which is hard to find since most 'Bancha' teas available in the US are actually from China. A nice tea to sip casually through out the day."

Sometimes these teas are labelled and sold as dragon well or long jing, whereas other times they are not. Dragon well is characterized by its unusual shape and characteristics of the dry leaves--long, flat, and very light weight. Long jing is available in many different grades with widely variable prices. Some of the higher-quality dragon well teas are considered highly desirable and can be very expensive. Long jing can be brewed similar to most other Chinese green teas. When measuring out the tea, keep in mind that the flat nature of the tea leaf can make the same amount of tea occupy less space than other loose-leaf green teas. In her post Brewing Long Jing (dragonwell), Gingko Seto of Life in Teacup recommends brewing this type of tea using water that is 185(degrees)-195(degrees)F (85(degrees)-90(degrees)C), a little hotter than for some green teas. Stephane of Tea Masters goes into a little more depth in his posts Dragon Well - Long Jin - facts and experiments and 3 brewing methods for Lung Jing tea, explaining that most tea shops recommend cooler temperatures (140(degrees)-160(degrees)F or 60(degrees)-70(degrees)C), but that higher temperatures are better for extracting flavor, and that high-quality long jing will usually not taste too bitter even when the water temperature is high. A Yunnan green tea which is also called Bao Hong Tea, is called Yi Liang Long Jing, meaning Yi Liang Dragon Well. This tea does resemble the traditional dragon well in processing and appearance, but less in taste.[1] ",

The dry tea is chopped quite fine. Adding the water rehabilitates the tea, though. The steeping tea does have the fresh, bitter, grassy aroma of a decent dragon well. After three minutes in 180(degrees)F water, the tea is a greenish amber. The flavor's better than I expected. The tea is fresh-tasting with just enough bitterness on the edges of the tongue and almost no astringency. The flavor is rich with a long finish. I'm quite surprised at the quality of the tea compared to the appearance of the dry tea bag. As the tea cools, the bitterness moves to the front a bit, but still isn't unpleasant. Some fruitiness appears with a hint of tart berries or melon. This tea isn't as complex as more expensive green teas and there's a bit of older tea leaf in the aftertaste, but it's still one of the best green teas available in regular tea bags.

            "about": "Gyokuro, meaning jewel dew but sometimes also called jade dew, is a style of Japanese green tea. It has a high amino acid content, giving it a bit of an 'umami' (or savory) flavor, uncommon among teas. Among teas, gyokuro and Anji bai cha have the highest known concentration of L-theanine, an amino acid derivative implicated in relaxation and improved concentration.[1] The theanine content of gyokuro is roughly twice that of typical teas. Gyokuro is mostly produced in Japan, although small amounts are now produced in China as well. Gyokuro is made from particular varieties of the tea plant, and is shade-grown for a few weeks before picking, leading the leaves to be rich in chlorophyll. The term 'shade-grown' in this context can be misleading for people familiar with shade-grown coffee. Unlike shade-grown coffees, which are grown under a mature forest canopy (and thus promote greater biodiversity than sun-grown coffees), gyokuro is grown in sun for most of its development, and is artificially shaded by covering the plants with canvas or another material. The shading of gyokuro thus affects the quality of the tea, but provides no additional ecological value. The process used to produce gyokuro is similar to the process used to produce matcha, a powdered green tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony. The two processes are identical until after the harvesting of the leaves, so matcha and gyokuro share certain similarities of flavor and aroma, and both share the intense green color, even though they are very different in texture and method of preparation. Most tea companies and tea drinkers recommend brewing gyokuro with a lower temperature of water than other green teas, usually 140-160(degrees)F or 60-71(degrees)C. Brewing gyokuro with higher temperature water can result in the presence of unpleasant qualities in the aroma. ",

Does not re-steep at all, one and done. Some of the vegetal taste of a gyokuro but like an artificial version, not balanced or rich.",
                "I'd really like to say something positive about this tea, but it's really just not good. I gave it several chances. I brewed it first using the method that worked reliably with the Maeda-en gyokuro, but it was bitter and made me extremely jittery. I tried converting the annoying, proprietary 'perfect spoonful' measurements into teaspoons (from what I found, 1 'perfect spoonful' = 2.5 tsp) and brewed it according to the DAVID's TEA directions, but it turned out even worse - horribly bitter and it made me so jittery that I couldn't even finish half a cup. I then compared brewing methods for gyokuro online and picked the safest one I could - 60(degrees)C for two minutes until the leaves unfurled, with a heaping tablespoon (6g) of tea leaves. There was an interesting, fresh green note to the taste, but it made me so jittery after several sips that I couldn't touch it after that. I really didn't like that it was finicky, but some teas are just like that. What really made me suspicious was how jittery it made me. No gyokuro I've ever had has made me jittery like that. The shading process that's innate to the production of gyokuro results in the production of amino acids that end up having a sedating effect, if anything. So, this went in the exact opposite direction. I went so far as to e-mail the company and ask them if it was really gyokuro or just sencha that they'd just decided to call 'gyokuro.' They insisted that it was gyokuro. But, I'd disagree. Even if you could slap the label of 'gyokuro' on this, it has none of the qualities that gyokuro is known for. The color is off - it's more yellow than green, and that's something I've seen from sencha and other more common varieties of green tea, not something I've seen from gyokuro or fukamushi, which have a more comparable taste and are both greener in color. There was a lack of dusting in the tea, which again, is counter to what I'd expect given my experience. This gave it the appearance more of sencha than of gyokuro. The flavor profile reminds me of the sencha ashikubo that I got from DAVID's TEA - buttery, green. There was a fresh, green note that came out when I brewed it at that low 60(degrees)C temperature. But, the effect the tea had on me was so horrible I could barely have three sips. I got a headache and was jittery beyond belief. I cannot recommend this at all. The scent of the dry leaves is good, a note or two of the tea is pretty good, but the overall taste is lacking in richness, the color is off, the effect is horrible...if this really is gyokuro tea, it's terrible gyokuro tea which doesn't deserve the label. If that weren't bad enough, it's extremely expensive (that's probably the only thing about it that seems even remotely like gyokuro is the price tag). Do not waste your money on this. I'd recommend either of the gyokuro teas that Maeda-en sells instead. They're much more delicious, have a nice relaxing effect, and brew reliably well. They're around ten cents more expensive per gram, but trust me, it's worth it. This gyokuro, by comparison, is undrinkable. It's better to pay ten cents more than feel like all the money you did spend is lost.",
                "This and the Maeda-en Gyokuro Grower's Select go hand-in-hand. This is the sweet one of the two while the Select is more savory/umami. Both brew well very consistently (which is great, considering that gyokuro is an expensive tea and not something you'd want to waste). I had good results with the following brewing method: Water: 300ml (I use a Hario teapot for this, which I had great results with as it allows a lot of room for the leaves to flow) Temperature: 75(degrees)C Tea: 2 1/2 tsp (or more, if you're planning multiple brewings of the same leaves) Time: ~2 minutes, ~3 minutes, etc. The Select is savory and umami and is more like the main course, while this Reserve was sweeter to me and was more like dessert. Just like the Select, this has a nice relaxing quality to it. There's a light mouthwatering quality to it. There is some saltiness, but I found it to be less intense than the Select. Both are rich and hearty but lean in different directions in terms of their notes. I haven't played around with the temperature or brewing times at all. I think that you could brew this using a more classic gyokuro method if you used cooler water, more leaves, and a different brewing time. (I've seen some gyokuro brewed with very low temperatures, for example, room temperature.) But, I was happy enough with the method listed. I didn't want to lose a serving of tea trying to find a better cup when I'm so satisfied with things as they are. I think both are very good and it really depends upon which taste profile you're looking for when choosing.",
                "This and the Maeda-en Gyokuro Grower's Reserve go hand-in-hand, because one is more savory and the other is more sweet.

I had good results with the following brewing method: Water: 300ml (I use a Hario teapot for this, which I had great results with as it allows a lot of room for the leaves to flow) Temperature: 75(degrees)C Tea: 2 tsp to 1 Tbsp (depending upon how strong you want it - I use 1 Tbsp when I'm planning on brewing the same leaves two or more times) Time: ~2 minutes, ~3 minutes, etc. Out of both teas, this one is more umami. It has a much more green flavor than sencha and lacks that classic, almost lightly roasted note that many senchas have. There's a mineral quality to it, but it's not very extreme. The effect that it has is relaxing and fortifying. I drink this tea when I want to relax, when I need nourishment and am not feeling well (in which case, I think of it a lot like a soup because of its heartiness and richness). While I have had this on a regular day (brewing it a few times and putting it in a thermos), it's really better-suited for when you can take the time to really enjoy it. The temperature is low and it cools quickly, so it's probably better for the warmer months (i.e. it won't help to warm you up in wintertime). Just like fukamushi, there is a dust that makes it through the fine strainer when brewing it and it adds to the richness and depth of the tea. This is one I consistently return to. To me, it's worth the cost. I found it for sale at Mitsuwa, the Japanese supermarket, and it's also available online directly from Maeda-en (you can get free shipping if you order a certain amount). There are no samples that I've seen available, but from my experience, this really is worth the risk if you enjoy rich teas with a green, slightly umami/salty flavor.",

One of my favorite things about both of these is that they brew well very consistently (which is great, considering that gyokuro is an expensive tea and not something you'd want to waste). I had good results with the following brewing method: Water: 300ml (I use a Hario teapot for this, which I had great results with as it allows a lot of room for the leaves to flow) Temperature: 75(degrees)C Tea: 2 tsp to 1 Tbsp (depending upon how strong you want it - I use 1 Tbsp when I'm planning on brewing the same leaves two or more times) Time: ~2 minutes, ~3 minutes, etc. Out of both teas, this one is more umami. It has a much more green flavor than sencha and lacks that classic, almost lightly roasted note that many senchas have. There's a mineral quality to it, but it's not very extreme. The effect that it has is relaxing and fortifying. I drink this tea when I want to relax, when I need nourishment and am not feeling well (in which case, I think of it a lot like a soup because of its heartiness and richness). While I have had this on a regular day (brewing it a few times and putting it in a thermos), it's really better-suited for when you can take the time to really enjoy it. The temperature is low and it cools quickly, so it's probably better for the warmer months (i.e. it won't help to warm you up in wintertime). Just like fukamushi, there is a dust that makes it through the fine strainer when brewing it and it adds to the richness and depth of the tea. This is one I consistently return to. To me, it's worth the cost. I found it for sale at Mitsuwa, the Japanese supermarket, and it's also available online directly from Maeda-en (you can get free shipping if you order a certain amount). There are no samples that I've seen available, but from my experience, this really is worth the risk if you enjoy rich teas with a green, slightly umami/salty flavor. Very vegetal, high caffeine/theanine concentration, good to wake-up or get focused and concentrate. One of my favorite!"

            "about": "Hojicha, sometimes spelled houjicha or written hoji cha, is a Japanese style of roasted green tea. The level of roast varies, but tends to be heavier than most roasted oolongs, giving the leaves and tea an appearance, flavor, and aroma totally distinct from most green teas, and indeed, from any other teas. Hojicha is a relatively new style of tea; it probably originated around 1920. There is one story that a Japanese merchant wanted to find a way to sell stale bancha, and invented hojicha as a way of turning this tea into something that could be sold; however, RateTea was unable to find a reliable source to verify this story and it may be a myth. Hojicha is usually made by roasting bancha, but is sometimes made from sencha, kukicha, or other varieties of green tea. If hojicha is created out of mature, winter leaves harvested in spring, we classify it as Kyobancha, rather than in this category. Hojicha made out of kukicha (made exclusively or primarily from twigs and stems) is also called hoji-kukicha, pictured below to the right. The leaves of hojicha are a deep, rich brown color and often have a flakey appearance. The tea brews a dark brown color, the flavor is mild, and the aroma is rich and toasty and lacks the vegetal tones characteristic of most green teas. The level of roast can vary greatly; some hojicha can have a smoky quality as well. The aroma of dark-roasted hojicha can be remarkably similar to the aroma of coffee, although hojicha has a definitively milder flavor. The roasting process destroys much of the caffeine, greatly lowering the caffeine content, and making this tea an excellent choice for those seeking a low-caffeine tea. The darker the roast, the less caffeine. Hojicha made from kukicha (twigs) is also lower in caffeine. ",

                "I was very impressed by this tea. The only other hoji-cha I've tried was from YamaMotoYama, and I enjoyed it. But, this had a more toasty, well-rounded scent to it. The leaves differed more in their shape and appearance, which made it look more natural. The tea also had a more nuanced flavor. It wasn't that expensive. But, Maeda-en tends to sell things in different amounts than one might expect, so pay attention to that when trying to understand how expensive this is. For example, the kuki-cha I got from them was 150g, but this was 80g. I'm not sure why they'd measure things out so differently. But, it's something to know before making an order. The images of bags look very similar in size online, so don't be misled by that. They are very different in size. I brewed the tea with 85(degrees)C water (which was an average of the high and low of the range listed on the bag), I used 2 tsp of tea per 110ml of water. For the first cup, I brewed it for about 20s, I kept it similar for the second cup 20-25s, then a bit longer for the third. It kept its flavor well. It was delicious and relaxing. It was the perfect tea for a cool day. It's the kind of thing that I could imagine on a peaceful evening in front of the fireplace, in the cool end of autumn or the winter, with snow falling outside. The notes in this tea warm you up in a very different way than spicy food or cinnamon might. It's not like drinking a cup of campfire, like the smokier lapsang souchong. It's more sweet and subtle than that. It's like drinking the mood of warmth. That's the best way I have to explain it. I'd highly recommend this if you're looking for a delicious, but inexpensive tea to warm you up in cool weather.",

                "An excellent roasted twig tea, crisp flavor and complex aroma! Probably my favorite roasted twig tea (i.e. not roasted leaf tea) that I have ever had. I tend to always like hojicha, but this was one of the more interesting batches I've tried in a while. This one is a roasted kukicha (twig tea) and the roast looks quite light, with considerable greenish color left in some of the twigs; the dry leaf smelled so strongly, a pleasant roasty aroma with notes of wood, but there was also an off note, that reminded me of fresh acrylic paint. I hope the cup doesn't smell like this!!! Thankfully, it does not! The cup actually reminds me a little bit of vanilla-flavored coffee, with a strong roasty aroma and notes of vanilla and cream. Flavor is bold and crisp, surprisingly so. Also, resteeps surprisingly well for a hojicha. Great price too!",
                "I love the quality of the wellness products available at Mood & Mind. So a while back when I found that they offered a few teas, I immediately ordered their Houjicha. I was not disappointed. Roasted leaves and twigs smell subtle but also rich. Brews up a nice brown color with flavors that remind me of Autumn. Toasty, smooth and just very flavorful.

It is also sometimes called haru bancha, meaning 'spring bancha', because it is harvested in spring. Although it is technically a type of bancha, as well as a type of hojicha, and can be classified in either category, it is quite different in character from the typical examples of both of these types of tea, and we thus classify it in a category of its own. Kyobancha is produced from tea leaves that have lasted through the winter. It is then roasted. The roasting imparts a smoky quality to it. The combination of the use of large, mature leaves, which are naturally lower in caffeine, and the roasting process, which breaks down caffeine, makes this tea very low in caffeine. Uncommon even in Japan, Kyobancha has been virtually unknown in Western Countries until recently. ",

Brewing the tea makes the roasted aroma and loamy aroma more intense and it brings in notes of umami as well. The taste is earthy, loamy, and a hint of woody with very mild roasted flavor. I have to be careful to not chug this tea because it is delicious and soothing. The mouthfeel is buttery and smooth. As the tea cools it becomes sweeter and smoother. ",
                "Roasting the bancha leaves produces a tea that combines the best of hojicha and bancha together in one brew. The light grassy flavors are enhanced by the light smokiness, and the astringency is cut to a minimum. The sample I had of this was used up quickly as I tried brewing it both hot and cold the same day, and both were equally satisfying. I hope to order more of this soon, as I have found all of Obubu's teas to be exceptionally delicious."

This tea tends to have a bold, strong flavor, especially relative to other green teas in its price range. This style of tea is unusual, especially among more desireable varieties of tea, in that it uses the second leaf on the branch and does not include any tips, buds, or higher leaves. The central vein of the leaf is removed, and the leaves are then pan-fired over low heat and shaped into their final form.[1] Although most sources classify Lu An melon seed as a green tea, Silk Road Teas refers to it as a yellow tea, due to the fact that it is subjected to an extra steaming phase in its processing.[2] We do not classify it in this manner, as the teas we classify in that way involve a slight oxidation, with the leaves sitting while damp, rather than additional heating.

This has a richer and bolder flavor than most other green teas, although I also found it to be somewhat muted. It's not crisp, more just like it has very bold undertones. Flavor seems a balance of sour, bitter, umami, and sweet, and almost suggests saltiness too. There's a bit of a bitter aftertaste, but I found it pleasing. I also found the aroma very complex and very pleasing, and hard to describe. It's almost reminiscent of matcha, but less vegetal, and more deep and dark, for lack of better descriptors. Somewhat floral, but suggestive of rose rather than the light, orchid-like fragrance of some teas. The aromas of this tea remind me of summer more than most fresh green teas, which remind me of spring. The other Lu An melon seed I tried was much grassier than this one. With the usual teaspoon of leaf, very easily makes two infusions, but the third is bland. Three infusions may work with briefer steepings and/or more leaf but I preferred this tea with a heaping teaspoon of leaf and a 2 minute infusion, followed by 3-4 minutes. It's easy to oversteep...I find there was a narrow window of steeping time and leaf quantity in which this tea was strong enough without being too strong, but when I liked it I really liked it. I found the tea was much less picky about temperature than steeping time."

Regardless, I got the sense this tea has quite a few, especially for a mass-produced bagged tea from a big tea company, and more discriminating tea drinkers than me should enjoy the process of teasing them out. Here were mine. Dry-bag aroma was pleasant, a little minty, a little malty, and a little monetary. By that, I mean it smelled somewhat like freshly printed U.S. paper money. When I was a kid, we got a school tour of the Federal Reserve in Dallas (the one putting the letter K on dollar bills), and were allowed to sniff (but not touch!) a stack of newly printed bills. So I know that scent. In the dry bag, it wasn't intense or offputting, just surprising, yet perhaps fitting for a good *green* tea. The in-cup and wet-bag aromas lost the smell of cash, but weren't bankrupt by any means. Instead they came across as both toasty and vegetal, somewhat rice-like, and rich, much like a couple of Japanese loose greens I've had. In fact the taste was quite good, and also bore a striking resemblance to a generic bagged green with a little matcha powder that my daughter brought home to me from a 7-11 in Tokyo. Mild bitterness came out in the flavor, but much more in the aftertaste, which also became slightly metallic after a few seconds. That minor weird experience aside, the flavor itself was robust, strong-bodied for a green, and rather like a baked pastry: sweet, malty, toasty, and even a little buttery. Yum. I have no qualms recommending this tea for budget-minded green-teabag drinkers who want something more interesting than the mostly bland store-brand stuff.",

The flavor is strong even while hot, but there's only a hint of green bitterness. Once the tea cools a little, the tea's complexity comes out. I get notes of clove and camphor. It's not as fruity as I was expecting from the initial aroma. Instead, the vegetal flavor is more pronounced. Rather than being grassy, the flavor is more like raw green beans. The finish of the warm tea is long and potent, making this an easy tea to savor. Unlike other reviewers, I think this tea compares well to loose leaf greens with a comparable price tag.

                "I tend to like Mao Jian teas a lot, and I still liked this one, but it was my least favorite example of it that I've tried. It was unexpectedly smooth but lacked edge or bite, and I think this bite is one of the things that I most appreciate about this type of tea. Dry leaf is wiry and curved, very dark green. Quite aromatic, the aroma is initially dusty and heavy but beneath this is a sweet, almost bready aroma. I was curious to try this; I couldn't tell much about how it was going to taste just by smelling the leaf. The brewed cup is skunky and...dank. You know when people smoke very potent weed that has that sort of illicit, dirty herbal smell? It smells a lot like that. The flavor is exceptionally smooth, almost too smooth, there's almost no astringency, yet it still comes across as being a bit heavy. I find I enjoy this tea more as it cools. I enjoy the smoothness more, and the metallic quality diminishes as the cup cools, and also the aroma feels gentler. Resteeps pretty well, but the second cup suffers from the same deficiency in flavor as the first. Overall, still enjoyable, and I suspect this may be a tea that others would appreciate more than me as I know smoothness is often a desirable quality, I just wished this tea had more edge and found it unsatisfying for this reason. I thought this tea was overpriced. Harney has marked it down from $52 to $39 a pound, but I *still* think it's overpriced; there are many less expensive green teas, both from Harney and other companies, that I'd prefer to this one.",
                "Although I like green tea, this is not one of my favorites. Although it seems to be of good quality, the taste is not for me. There is a strong vegetal flavor as well as a bitterness present throughout that I am not fond of. That being said, the aroma is very pleasant with a strong vegetal smell. It seems to be a good cup of tea, just not my style. ",

At the finish there was a tiny hint of cut grass and a surprising note of dulse. The first steep keeps up the savory notes, blending sauteed mushrooms, some mild bok choy, a bit of edamame nuttiness, and a tiny bit of potatoes and dulse at the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and the taste is mild at the first, but delightfully savory.",
                "When I snipped open the little pouch this tea came in and gave it a good sniff, the first thing I noticed is how brothy, almost meaty the leaves smell, how intriguing! Once I poured the leaves I planned on steeping into my official sniffing dish, the leaves still retained their hint of broth, but it became more of a vegetable broth with strong notes of spinach, nuttiness, and fresh vegetation. There is a faint finish of sweetness like roasted chestnuts, the aroma of this tea certainly has a strong presence, I could sniff it for hours. The first steeping's taste starts out very vegetal, almost a bitter green taste of kale, spinach, and bok choy, but that very quickly fades to a fruity sweetness. The fruitiness reminds me of very delicate pear nectar with a hint of spicebush. The mouthfeel is great, it is one of those teas that tickles the mouth from the delicate hairs that are present on the leaf, one of my favorite things about drinking fuzzy teas."

I tend to like Mao Jian teas a lot, and I still liked this one, but it was my least favorite example of it that I've tried. It was unexpectedly smooth but lacked edge or bite, and I think this bite is one of the things that I most appreciate about this type of tea. Dry leaf is wiry and curved, very dark green. Quite aromatic, the aroma is initially dusty and heavy but beneath this is a sweet, almost bready aroma. I was curious to try this; I couldn't tell much about how it was going to taste just by smelling the leaf. The brewed cup is skunky and...dank. You know when people smoke very potent weed that has that sort of illicit, dirty herbal smell? It smells a lot like that. The flavor is exceptionally smooth, almost too smooth, there's almost no astringency, yet it still comes across as being a bit heavy. I find I enjoy this tea more as it cools. I enjoy the smoothness more, and the metallic quality diminishes as the cup cools, and also the aroma feels gentler. Resteeps pretty well, but the second cup suffers from the same deficiency in flavor as the first. Overall, still enjoyable, and I suspect this may be a tea that others would appreciate more than me as I know smoothness is often a desirable quality, I just wished this tea had more edge and found it unsatisfying for this reason. I thought this tea was overpriced. Harney has marked it down from $52 to $39 a pound, but I *still* think it's overpriced; there are many less expensive green teas, both from Harney and other companies, that I'd prefer to this one. Although I like green tea, this is not one of my favorites. Although it seems to be of good quality, the taste is not for me. There is a strong vegetal flavor as well as a bitterness present throughout that I am not fond of. That being said, the aroma is very pleasant with a strong vegetal smell. It seems to be a good cup of tea, just not my style.  The aroma is delightfully savory, mixing notes of sundried tomato. tomato leaves, spinach, and a bit of sauteed mushrooms. At the finish there was a tiny hint of cut grass and a surprising note of dulse. The first steep keeps up the savory notes, blending sauteed mushrooms, some mild bok choy, a bit of edamame nuttiness, and a tiny bit of potatoes and dulse at the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and the taste is mild at the first, but delightfully savory. When I snipped open the little pouch this tea came in and gave it a good sniff, the first thing I noticed is how brothy, almost meaty the leaves smell, how intriguing! Once I poured the leaves I planned on steeping into my official sniffing dish, the leaves still retained their hint of broth, but it became more of a vegetable broth with strong notes of spinach, nuttiness, and fresh vegetation. There is a faint finish of sweetness like roasted chestnuts, the aroma of this tea certainly has a strong presence, I could sniff it for hours. The first steeping's taste starts out very vegetal, almost a bitter green taste of kale, spinach, and bok choy, but that very quickly fades to a fruity sweetness. The fruitiness reminds me of very delicate pear nectar with a hint of spicebush. The mouthfeel is great, it is one of those teas that tickles the mouth from the delicate hairs that are present on the leaf, one of my favorite things about drinking fuzzy teas."

Matcha, however, is not just powdered gyokuro. To produce matcha, the same leaves used to produce gyokuro are dried by a different process, producing a type of tea called tencha. Matcha is then produced by removing the stems and leaf veins of the tencha, and grinding the remainder of the leaf to a fine powder. The intermediate step, tencha, is not widely available outside of Japan. Matcha is the type of tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony. To prepare matcha, the powder is added directly to water and, unlike most other teas, is not filtered out. The powder can be filtered through a sieve before adding it to water, to break up clumps. The traditional method of brewing matcha involves mixing it with a bamboo whisk in a bowl. Brewed matcha has an opaque, bright-green color and strong flavor. Although the flavor of matcha closely resembles other green teas in many ways, the opacity and consistency of the brewed tea is unlike any other. Because of its finely-powdered form, matcha is easily added to desserts, baked goods, and other foods in order to impart a strong green tea flavor. Because matcha is so expensive, companies sell special cooking grade matcha or kitchen grade matcha, also called culinary grade, for the purpose of adding to desserts or other foods. This matcha is usually more astringent than the matcha intended for drinking. The finely-powdered state of matcha makes it lose its aroma quickly; once opened, it does not stay fresh as long as most green teas. Matcha is also sometimes added or blended into green teas, including those available in teabags. Matcha is often blended with genmaicha, resulting in a blend called Matcha-iri genmaicha. Matcha is typically made in Japan, although it is also made in other regions as well, including in Kenya. In addition to the familiar style of matcha, Kenya also produces a matcha-like powdered white tea called white matcha.

I've had only one other Sejak (although I've had other types of Korean green teas, all of which I liked better) and it was pretty similar. I initially brewed this one with around 180 degree water, but I find it tastes better when the water is even cooler. The hotter the water is, I find the more bitter this tea gets. If you use around 160F degree water it comes out very sweet and savory and with what seemed like the perfect amount of bitterness. The aroma is very seaweedy and vegetal, lots of ocean aromas. It reminds me of being at a restaurant on the wharf in maine. Even smells a little like crabmeat. 2nd cup remarkably seaweedy; I find this quality persists more through the second cup than is typical. Flavor is bold in both cups. There's a moderate amount of bitterness, and also some astringency. I find that this tea also leaves a bit of a tingling sensation on the palate, and a slight metallic aftertaste. Cooling, crisp, and fresh. Infuses relatively quickly (possibly because the leaf is pretty finely broken). I like at most a 2 minute first steep but I think slightly shorter than that is ideal. It was interesting to try, but the price is just too high for me to recommend buying this regularly.

Dry leaf doesn't have much smell, but the minute the water hits the leaves there is an explosion of aroma that reminds me of very good Japanese sencha. But once the tea has steeped it has a very different aroma, more like a Chinese green tea, very grassy, and with some toasty and floral tones. Flavor is strong and quite brisk, but pleasantly so. Strong umami or savory flavor. This is among one of the most umami teas I've ever tried, making it taste a lot like gyokuro or kabusecha. Really potent, and brews very fast. Arbor teas gave a generic recommendation of a 2-3 minute steeping. I thought that produced a first cup that was too strong, and then I tried resteeping, and that did not go well. The resulting cup was bitter and astringent, but lacked most of the pleasant aromatic qualities and was also watery. I liked this tea better if steeped for only a minute or less for the first cup, and not much longer for the second. This produces a first cup that smelled more vegetal and tasted smoother, but still very savory / umami. This tea still did not work as well as some for multiple infusions, but more of the toasty tones came out in the second cup this way. This may be though because the sample I received was the bottom of the bag, and the leaf was more broken than it normally would be, but I did notice overall that the leaf looked much more broken than it does in the picture on the Arbor Teas' website...whether that's a question of handling post-shipping, I don't know. Very enjoyable. But, for me, far too pricey for a tea that doesn't resteep that well. "

It is the variety of Japanese green tea that is most commonly available in the United States, in contrast to bancha, which is a common tea in Japan, but less known in the U.S. Sencha is widely produced not only in Japan but in China and other countries as well. Brewed sencha often has a more intense green color than pan-fired (Chinese) green teas, but less green than gyokuro. Sencha is diverse in both flavor and aroma, but it often tends to have a bold, sharp flavor and an aroma which is often described as grassy and vegetal, sometimes even seaweed-like. Sencha is produced by steaming the leaves before drying, and then firing them afterwards, in contrast to teas which are pan-fired before drying. The characters for sencha literally translate as 'pan-fired tea', which can be confusing because the term 'pan-fired' usually refers to green teas (including many Chinese varieties) which are pan-fired before drying, at the stage at which sencha is steamed.",

                "Half-litre pot at home, made from a sample included in the tea company's Advent Tea Calendar (2020) and consisting of very fine Sencha leaves, some of them even pulverised - not a good sign in a tea from a respectable company selling quality products. Pours clear very pale green (against white china), with no sediment. Faint aroma of Sencha leaves, i.e. beans and fart, if anything. Very mild flavour of Sencha, actually barely detectable, with a mildly beany aftertaste on a slightly rough palate. Well, honestly, I do not know what to think of it. I have never been a fan of pure Sencha (unlike flavoured green tea, which I usually like a lot), but I keep giving it a chance. I followed the brewing time specified on the packaging (nay, actually exceeded it by 25(percent)), wondering why it was so short. And, well, sure enough, the flavour is hard to be impressed by. For those who like Sencha, this sample probably comes at a reasonable price, given the context (ca. (euros)0.42 per 1 sample in the collection).

                "Update: I found a way to brew it better. 80(degrees)C water, 110ml water per 2 tsp of tea, 20 seconds for the first cup, 20-25 seconds for the second cup... The tea is very, very grassy. It's more grassy than any other sencha I've ever had (or any green tea, for that matter). It's not buttery. It's more like brewing a nice, hot cup of lawn. That might not appeal to everyone. Personally, I have to be in the mood for something this grassy. The taste goes along with the scent of the dry tea. I think part of the factor in the improvement of the taste is that I let it sit (some teas seem to need to be opened and then left to sit before they brew better, for some reason). I think the other factor was in adding more tea (I believe my first try was with 1 tsp). Still, I'm not very fond of the intense grassiness. It's too overwhelming. I think I could knock it down to 1 1/2 tsp and it would probably be better, with all other directions for brewing staying the same. The feeling it imparts is very strong, in terms of caffeine. It's not relaxing. It made me a bit jittery. There's something about the aroma of the dry tea that I don't like, but I can't put my finger on it. It's not a spoiled note, but it's nagging. I don't know what it is. While this doesn't factor into my rating of the tea itself, I wanted to note that I did e-mail Maeda-en for suggestions on brewing and they ignored me completely. This isn't new. While they are good with order-related customer service, their 'service' when it comes to things like this is non-existent. Their tea directions (both on their website and on tea packages) are also painfully vague. -- And, I mean painfully vague. Imagine someone asking directions from Maine to Florida and getting the answer of: 'go south.' They put no thought into it at all and it's a shame because with the more expensive teas, it leads to a customer wasting tea trying to figure out the best brewing settings. It would also take such little effort to improve upon this, which is maddening. Give a tea master a pouch of that variety of tea, ask them what their recommended settings are, and then put on the site or the package: 'tea master recommendations for brewing...' Not hard, not time-consuming, really helpful for customers. But, left entirely undone. This is one of the things I like to consider when buying a tea, so I'm leaving this note here. On contrast, a company like TeaVivre has recommended settings that are very detailed on their tea pages (for both Western and Eastern style brewing) and their customer service will work with you until you are satisfied with the tea. I've had finicky teas where I've e-mailed back and forth with TeaVivre customer service easily 10x. But, I got a good brew in the end. It's definitely something to consider when choosing where to purchase tea. Previous Review: I actually wasn't impressed with this one. These days, I've tended to favor fukamushi sencha over typical sencha. But, even with taking that into consideration, there was a marked lack of flavor and fullness in this tea. It was weak in scent, in taste, and in body. It didn't even have notes that were more particular to lighter teas (not that sencha is typically so light, in my experience). I will try making it in a few different ways to see if I can improve the experience. At this point in time, the kukicha tea I got in the same order from Maeda-en was actually significantly better. If you aren't familiar with Japanese teas, kukicha is made with stems and small pieces of leaves and is thus considered to be lower in quality than teas that feature larger leaf pieces or full leaves such as this sencha (it also was a fraction of the cost, $7.50 (150g) for kukicha vs. $21.50 (57g) for this sencha ). I'd say that it's strange, but honestly, this happens with tea sometimes. I've spent lots of money on tea that is basically garbage; I've spent almost nothing on tea that is delicious. Still, it's a shame when it happens, because it really feels like you're getting ripped off. I hope that I have better experiences when trying this in the future (I'll update if I do). As is, I wouldn't recommend this at all.",
                "I was surprised, but also not, about this super premium shincha. You see, I know my tastes and I know that I've loved some 'cheap' teas because even though they were inexpensive, they were great teas. I've also had some disappointing experiences with really expensive teas. So, I purchased this with that knowledge somewhere at the back of my mind. Now, I tried brewing this the same way as the other shincha that I got from Maeda-en and it turned out terrible. I thought I'd go for an even lower temperature, so I went from 75(degrees)C to 70(degrees)C, and holy heck, it felt like I got hit in the head. The effect that the caffeine had on me was miserable. My body was miserable and I could barely finish two small 110ml cups. I then went searching around online and found a suggestion to raise the temperature instead. I didn't want to go to far, so I just settled on 80(degrees)C. This took away that nasty effect, but the tea didn't have nearly as much of a fullness as the other shincha. Now, I'm open to the notion that this 75/100 rating is more demonstrative of my brewing method. I'd be happy to revise and try to find a better method. But, for the time being, this is the best I've found. I'd be very hesitant to try a low temperature again. I think if I did, I'd try something really, really low -- my kettle goes as low as 40(degrees)C, though I think I'd try 45(degrees)C or 50(degrees)C. I definitely wouldn't try anything in the 70-75(degrees)C range again. I'll add any notes I have if and when I decide to experiment. For the time being, I'd say that I much prefer the other shincha. I wouldn't order this one again. It was a strange and interesting taste experience, though. The leaves are also beautiful. They're so thin and slender. They look almost like green pine needles. Update: After brewing this many, many times, I started to have better results. First of all, 80(degrees)C is much better than other temperatures. I use 1tsp (heaping) per 110ml and start at around 20s, then increment up by 5-10s for a few brews. I think that part of it might actually be just letting it sit. I have noticed other green teas not brewing well right after harvest. Maybe some people prefer them this way. To me, they're undrinkable (some of them). It takes some time for them to 'calm down' and then they're quite good. I think the other part was just the brewing process and learning to do it more smoothly. It did take me time to get this one just right, but it was a good tea afterward, so I'm raising the rating. I'd say that I still prefer the other shincha, but this one is much better than before."

            "doc": "Sencha, also sometimes called honcha, is a Japanese style of green tea that is widespread and well-known not only in Japan, but worldwide. It is the variety of Japanese green tea that is most commonly available in the United States, in contrast to bancha, which is a common tea in Japan, but less known in the U.S. Sencha is widely produced not only in Japan but in China and other countries as well. Brewed sencha often has a more intense green color than pan-fired (Chinese) green teas, but less green than gyokuro. Sencha is diverse in both flavor and aroma, but it often tends to have a bold, sharp flavor and an aroma which is often described as grassy and vegetal, sometimes even seaweed-like. Sencha is produced by steaming the leaves before drying, and then firing them afterwards, in contrast to teas which are pan-fired before drying. The characters for sencha literally translate as 'pan-fired tea', which can be confusing because the term 'pan-fired' usually refers to green teas (including many Chinese varieties) which are pan-fired before drying, at the stage at which sencha is steamed.This is an unexciting but perfectly drinkable sencha, that is offered at a fair price by Upton. There is a little iron and spinach in the flavor, but not enough to be irritating. It wouldn't hurt to some of this in your cupboard. Half-litre cup at home, made from organic Sencha leaves. Pours clear pale olive green / lemon juice yellow (against white china) with no sediment. Mild aroma of Sencha leaves. Ditto flavour, with delicate malty notes. Mildly astringent aftertaste with leafy and malty touches. Well, a very decent Sencha, I suppose, although I am generally not a fan of this style. Expensive ((euros)15.40 per 100 g), but this is usually the case with tea from South Korea in Europe, and this one is organic on top of that. Worth trying, though. 8 4 2 77 12 g / l; 80 C; 2 min. Review #198  Half-litre pot at home, made from a sample included in the tea company's Advent Tea Calendar (2020) and consisting of very fine Sencha leaves, some of them even pulverised - not a good sign in a tea from a respectable company selling quality products. Pours clear very pale green (against white china), with no sediment. Faint aroma of Sencha leaves, i.e. beans and fart, if anything. Very mild flavour of Sencha, actually barely detectable, with a mildly beany aftertaste on a slightly rough palate. Well, honestly, I do not know what to think of it. I have never been a fan of pure Sencha (unlike flavoured green tea, which I usually like a lot), but I keep giving it a chance. I followed the brewing time specified on the packaging (nay, actually exceeded it by 25(percent)), wondering why it was so short. And, well, sure enough, the flavour is hard to be impressed by. For those who like Sencha, this sample probably comes at a reasonable price, given the context (ca. (euros)0.42 per 1 sample in the collection). I do not entertain the idea of investing in a regular portion, though. 5 2 3 40 11 g / l; 90 C; 1 min. Review #149  Update: I found a way to brew it better. 80(degrees)C water, 110ml water per 2 tsp of tea, 20 seconds for the first cup, 20-25 seconds for the second cup... The tea is very, very grassy. It's more grassy than any other sencha I've ever had (or any green tea, for that matter). It's not buttery. It's more like brewing a nice, hot cup of lawn. That might not appeal to everyone. Personally, I have to be in the mood for something this grassy. The taste goes along with the scent of the dry tea. I think part of the factor in the improvement of the taste is that I let it sit (some teas seem to need to be opened and then left to sit before they brew better, for some reason). I think the other factor was in adding more tea (I believe my first try was with 1 tsp). Still, I'm not very fond of the intense grassiness. It's too overwhelming. I think I could knock it down to 1 1/2 tsp and it would probably be better, with all other directions for brewing staying the same. The feeling it imparts is very strong, in terms of caffeine. It's not relaxing. It made me a bit jittery. There's something about the aroma of the dry tea that I don't like, but I can't put my finger on it. It's not a spoiled note, but it's nagging. I don't know what it is. While this doesn't factor into my rating of the tea itself, I wanted to note that I did e-mail Maeda-en for suggestions on brewing and they ignored me completely. This isn't new. While they are good with order-related customer service, their 'service' when it comes to things like this is non-existent. Their tea directions (both on their website and on tea packages) are also painfully vague. -- And, I mean painfully vague. Imagine someone asking directions from Maine to Florida and getting the answer of: 'go south.' They put no thought into it at all and it's a shame because with the more expensive teas, it leads to a customer wasting tea trying to figure out the best brewing settings. It would also take such little effort to improve upon this, which is maddening. Give a tea master a pouch of that variety of tea, ask them what their recommended settings are, and then put on the site or the package: 'tea master recommendations for brewing...' Not hard, not time-consuming, really helpful for customers. But, left entirely undone. This is one of the things I like to consider when buying a tea, so I'm leaving this note here. On contrast, a company like TeaVivre has recommended settings that are very detailed on their tea pages (for both Western and Eastern style brewing) and their customer service will work with you until you are satisfied with the tea. I've had finicky teas where I've e-mailed back and forth with TeaVivre customer service easily 10x. But, I got a good brew in the end. It's definitely something to consider when choosing where to purchase tea. Previous Review: I actually wasn't impressed with this one. These days, I've tended to favor fukamushi sencha over typical sencha. But, even with taking that into consideration, there was a marked lack of flavor and fullness in this tea. It was weak in scent, in taste, and in body. It didn't even have notes that were more particular to lighter teas (not that sencha is typically so light, in my experience). I will try making it in a few different ways to see if I can improve the experience. At this point in time, the kukicha tea I got in the same order from Maeda-en was actually significantly better. If you aren't familiar with Japanese teas, kukicha is made with stems and small pieces of leaves and is thus considered to be lower in quality than teas that feature larger leaf pieces or full leaves such as this sencha (it also was a fraction of the cost, $7.50 (150g) for kukicha vs. $21.50 (57g) for this sencha ). I'd say that it's strange, but honestly, this happens with tea sometimes. I've spent lots of money on tea that is basically garbage; I've spent almost nothing on tea that is delicious. Still, it's a shame when it happens, because it really feels like you're getting ripped off. I hope that I have better experiences when trying this in the future (I'll update if I do). As is, I wouldn't recommend this at all. I was surprised, but also not, about this super premium shincha. You see, I know my tastes and I know that I've loved some 'cheap' teas because even though they were inexpensive, they were great teas. I've also had some disappointing experiences with really expensive teas. So, I purchased this with that knowledge somewhere at the back of my mind. Now, I tried brewing this the same way as the other shincha that I got from Maeda-en and it turned out terrible. I thought I'd go for an even lower temperature, so I went from 75(degrees)C to 70(degrees)C, and holy heck, it felt like I got hit in the head. The effect that the caffeine had on me was miserable. My body was miserable and I could barely finish two small 110ml cups. I then went searching around online and found a suggestion to raise the temperature instead. I didn't want to go to far, so I just settled on 80(degrees)C. This took away that nasty effect, but the tea didn't have nearly as much of a fullness as the other shincha. Now, I'm open to the notion that this 75/100 rating is more demonstrative of my brewing method. I'd be happy to revise and try to find a better method. But, for the time being, this is the best I've found. I'd be very hesitant to try a low temperature again. I think if I did, I'd try something really, really low -- my kettle goes as low as 40(degrees)C, though I think I'd try 45(degrees)C or 50(degrees)C. I definitely wouldn't try anything in the 70-75(degrees)C range again. I'll add any notes I have if and when I decide to experiment. For the time being, I'd say that I much prefer the other shincha. I wouldn't order this one again. It was a strange and interesting taste experience, though. The leaves are also beautiful. They're so thin and slender. They look almost like green pine needles. Update: After brewing this many, many times, I started to have better results. First of all, 80(degrees)C is much better than other temperatures. I use 1tsp (heaping) per 110ml and start at around 20s, then increment up by 5-10s for a few brews. I think that part of it might actually be just letting it sit. I have noticed other green teas not brewing well right after harvest. Maybe some people prefer them this way. To me, they're undrinkable (some of them). It takes some time for them to 'calm down' and then they're quite good. I think the other part was just the brewing process and learning to do it more smoothly. It did take me time to get this one just right, but it was a good tea afterward, so I'm raising the rating. I'd say that I still prefer the other shincha, but this one is much better than before."

                "This is, easily, the most striking tea that I've ever had in my life -- and I've had hundreds. First of all, the scent was lightly fruity at the same time that it exhibited notes similar to the umami gyokuro green tea. The color was the most rich green I'd ever seen. I think the description had said that it leans to a blue and it almost does. It's so green, it's almost blue. But, none of this prepared me for the flavor. I brewed 1 tsp with 110ml of water heated to 75(degrees)C for about 20-30s (no rinse). There was some dusting in it -- about as much as fukamushi-cha. The color was a deep green, edging on blue. The flavor was like nothing I'd ever tasted before. The tea had more body than even the most premium green oolongs I'd had. There was such a fullness in the breath, with a sweet/umami note that was so complex, I'd like to think myself good at describing things, but I'm at a loss for words. There was an energy to the tea, beyond anything I'd ever experienced before. It has so much life in it and it's so obvious. I'm almost glad that I spent my life trying hundreds of other teas first. Because, if I'd had this first, I'd have been ruined for other teas. The flavor is very interesting, it's so complex and so full, but it's not the kind of thing that I think I'd tire of. It's already sold out on the online shop. There were a handful left when I made my own order. With how good this tea is, I can see why people rush to snatch it up. It's seasonal, so it won't be back in stock until spring. Shin-cha, you see, is the first crop and it isn't stored before going through the process to prepare it for consumption and then being sent out. So, this is the freshest you can get, short of picking tea leaves right off the bush. I'd definitely buy more of this in the future. This is astounding tea. It's in a league of its own. It's also a pleasure that's not the least bit guilty. Because, you have to drink it as soon as possible. You have to absolutely devour this tea, so that it's as fresh as possible when you do. You really shouldn't store it. It also feels so incredibly nourishing. So, my only concern is the inevitable sadness over finishing the last drop and having to wait until next year for more. I'd recommend this to try to anyone in a heartbeat. You must like green/umami flavored teas, though. This is more like gyokuro than any other tea. So, if you don't like gyokuro, this wouldn't be for you. But, if you do enjoy a green/umami gyokuro with a sweetness, this would be above and beyond that and you'd likely fall in love with it at first sip. I'm going to continue on, brewing as many cups out of this as possible. If you manage to pick some up for yourself at some point, enjoy! Update: I'm changing this to 100/100. This is perfect tea, even though I typically think that 'nothing is perfect,' this is perfect tea. So, it deserves the rating. As for the value, this is a bit expensive, but it's also worth it. So, I'm giving it 5-stars there."

The leaves often reach several inches in length. The name is sometimes translated peaceful monkey king or peaceful monkey leader, but there is a bit more in the name of this tea. The leaves of this tea can be too long to brew in many traditional vessels for brewing tea, both Western (like a tea ball or basket infuser) or Chinese (like a gaiwan). To brew this tea, the leaf can be broken into pieces, or it can be steeped loose in a tall mug. Although Taiping can be translated as peace and security, it also is the name of the county in which this tea originates. Interestingly, the first character alone, tai, means big, or extreme, a possible coincidence describing the unusually large leaves of this tea. The third character, hou, meaning monkey, also is the first character of Hougang and Houkeng, two villages in the area that grows this tea. The cultivar used to produce Taiping hou kui is called shi da cha, meaning big persimmon tea.",

It is definitely something different, unique, and extremely interesting. I fully enjoyed watching the leaves steep as the softened into long leaves. The aroma is light and sweet. It has a hint of grassiness, but nothing too strong. Everything about this tea is definitely well-rounded and warm. The taste is very well-rounded. It has notes of vegetation, mostly fresh cut grass. There are also very very slight hints of flowers. At the same time, it has a buttery sweetness and lightness that pulls it all together. The lightness and warmth of the taste is by far the most defining factor. It is simply extremely well-rounded. No single taste stands out from the others. The aftertaste is extremely pleasing and sits very well in the mouth. There is no astringent aftertaste. Overall an excellent tea that is fun to brew and very enjoyable in the mouth.",

The first infusion of this tea struck me as having a cooling quality, overall, but, like Upton says in their description, also a thick mouthfeel. There's a smoky, dusty quality, like in some lower grades of gunpowder and chun mee. It did not strike me as particularly sweet: rather it seemed, to me, slightly sour, and muted in flavor. There are some subtle tones that come out upon drinking, including corn. Very pleasing on the palate while drinking, but leaving a dry, dusty finish that was less-than-satisfing. Through this whole cup, I wanted more aroma. A second infusion was much more rich and flavorful, but the aroma was still weaker than I would like. This cup shared certain qualities in common with other long-leaf greens, including ones from diverse regions such as Thailand and Darjeeling. There is a certain soapy quality to it, however, which I dislike. I've sometimes encountered this soapy quality in the first infusion of greener oolongs. I tried brewing a third infusion but the leaves were spent, and the result tasted like little more than water. The whole process makes me think I did not brew this tea optimally, as most of the flavor went into the second cup. Bottom line, I was disappointed. This tea is pricey, and in quality or versalitility, it did not compare to a number of Chinese teas that I've tried from Upton as well as other companies. Even some of Upton's inexpensive green teas really impress me more than this did.",

The flavor could be a bit stronger (for my tastes) but I think lovers of good greens would appreciate this one!"

            "doc": "Taiping hou kui, sometimes referred to just as hou kui or as hou kui tea, is a type of Chinese green tea originating in Taiping county of Anhui province, consisting of enormous, long, flat leaves. The leaves often reach several inches in length. The name is sometimes translated peaceful monkey king or peaceful monkey leader, but there is a bit more in the name of this tea. The leaves of this tea can be too long to brew in many traditional vessels for brewing tea, both Western (like a tea ball or basket infuser) or Chinese (like a gaiwan). To brew this tea, the leaf can be broken into pieces, or it can be steeped loose in a tall mug. Although Taiping can be translated as peace and security, it also is the name of the county in which this tea originates. Interestingly, the first character alone, tai, means big, or extreme, a possible coincidence describing the unusually large leaves of this tea. The third character, hou, meaning monkey, also is the first character of Hougang and Houkeng, two villages in the area that grows this tea. The cultivar used to produce Taiping hou kui is called shi da cha, meaning big persimmon tea.I thoroughly enjoyed this tea, all the way from the beautiful tea leaves to the aftertaste. I wanted to try Tai Ping Hou Kui due to its intriguing leaf shape. It is definitely something different, unique, and extremely interesting. I fully enjoyed watching the leaves steep as the softened into long leaves. The aroma is light and sweet. It has a hint of grassiness, but nothing too strong. Everything about this tea is definitely well-rounded and warm. The taste is very well-rounded. It has notes of vegetation, mostly fresh cut grass. There are also very very slight hints of flowers. At the same time, it has a buttery sweetness and lightness that pulls it all together. The lightness and warmth of the taste is by far the most defining factor. It is simply extremely well-rounded. No single taste stands out from the others. The aftertaste is extremely pleasing and sits very well in the mouth. There is no astringent aftertaste. Overall an excellent tea that is fun to brew and very enjoyable in the mouth. This tea is beautiful in appearance so it is not surprising that the aroma is also beautiful. It is very vegetal and slightly sweet. Once the leaves are brewed it is still very vegetal but also has a slight nuttiness. The taste is smooth and the mouthfeel is buttery. it is vegetal and sweet with notes of sweetness and nuttiness, a delicious tea.

It originated as an export product in the 1930's, sold primarily to Muslim countries, which historically consume Chinese-type green teas. The steamed version is called mushi-guri or mushi-sei-cha tamaryoku, and is similar in overall character to sencha; it was developed by skipping a step in the production process of sencha, leading to a similar-looking curved appearance to the finished leaf.[1] The steamed version is more widely available in Western countries, but is not common there. It tends to be a premium-priced product. Guricha tends to be produced on Kyushu island, such as in Saga prefecture. Mushi-guricha is also produced in Shizuoka.

It hasn't caused me any throat irritation the way that the Tazo tea did, though, which is great! The flavor was quite present, but I wouldn't have minded it being even stronger. I'll be very tempted to use more than a teaspoon's worth of leaf next time. I brewed this tea at 180 (degrees)F for a minute and half and didn't have any problem with bitterness being created. I'll have to look into more Guricha style teas. I tried this tea chilled and hot with a few drops of lemon juice. Both were quite tasty. If you like lemon, it blends well and a little goes a long way. Also, if you didn't use quite enough leaf and the tea looks a bit light, letting the tea sit and warm at a low temperature is a good way to concentrate the flavor.

                "A classic chun mee, pretty much what I'd expect for this type of tea. Somewhat broken leaf, with a strong refreshing aroma, brews a dark cup. Dry leaf is very aromatic, smelling herbaceous and almost minty. Aroma of the brewed cup is suggestive of gingerbread and fresh herbs. This tea is tangy, but it's not the most sour example of this style of tea, which tends to be on the sour side. Although I always find Chun Mee picky about brewing temperature, I found this tea a tiny bit more forgiving than normal. Although the dry leaf did not look impressive (finely broken pieces--it looked more broken than the picture on the website suggests), I found this an above-average tea in terms of flavor. A little pricier than other Chun Mee I've tried of similar quality, but this is understandable as it is both organic and fair trade certified. I find it is possible to find organic-certified Chun Mee for cheaper (see Upton's Chun Mee Dao Ming, slightly cheaper, or the MUCH cheaper Chun Mee Moon Palace, two of my favorites) but it's hard to find anything Fair Trade certified.",
                "This struck me as an average-quality chun mee (precious eyebrows) green tea for a very low price. Not the best tea of its type that I've sampled, but certainly the best at this price point. I bought this tea in a Square tin for the pretty low price of $8 for 8 ounces, which seemed outright cheap to me. The cup is pretty aromatic, and has floral nuances. Flavor is crisp and tangy; there's quite a lot of astringency. It's important to take care in brewing; if the water is too hot, this can get harsh tasting. When brewed properly, I find this tea has a cool, refreshing quality. A good and inexpensive everyday tea, but I would prefer spending a bit more to get something a step or two up. Among Foojoy's loose-leaf offerings I prefer their Triple Cup Extra Green, probably their closest tea to this one that is superior in quality. My favorite chun mee is Upton Tea Import's Chun Mee Dao Ming, a little pricier (still cheap) but with a much more complex aroma."

Chun mee can be a good tea to choose as a base for blending with mint, to prepare Moroccan mint tea or a similar blend.This has a pleasant, grassy aroma that comes thru clearly. The dominant flavor is herbal bitterness, but it does not become overbearing when brewed according to the directions. The price could not be better for an organic product. This is a good choice for an everyday green tea.  Enjoyable but not amazing, not really standing out much among this style of tea. Smoother and less acidic than the norm for chun mee, but also perhaps a bit more boring too. The dry leaf has a dusty vegetal aroma, slightly smoky, with a few sweet notes, kind of what I'd expect from this type of tea. Brewed, this tasted deeper than most chun mee. It had a slight but deep sort of bitterness, and more vegetal and herbaceous notes. It was less crisp and acidic than I expect from this style, and less smoky. Resteeped well and the second cup was similarly deep and subdued. I experimented with brewing temperature. Normally I find Chun Mee is very sensitive to brewing temperature, but this one worked just fine with boiling water. It was surprisingly smooth, neither too sour nor too astringent, nor with any off aromas. I actually found I wanted more astringency even on the round where I used boiling water. Chun mee is a cheap tea, and although I think it offers good value, I've had cheaper teas that were about as good as this (Foojoy comes to mind). That tea might be a little more edgy, but then again, I like that, when I choose this type of tea it's because I want something with a bit of bite. This was my first loose tea from Foojoy, and I was rather pleased. A good solid green that is both inexpensive and has good flavor. Although I had seen Foojoy loose teas in their tins at my local Asian market, I had never tried any since I was not ready to take a chance on about $9.50 for 8 ounces; a very good price, but me loathe to spend without tasting! So, many thanks to Alex Z. for sharing a sample with me! My first steeping was a generous teaspoon of leaves, with about 8 ounces of water at 185 degrees F. Two minutes yielded a crisp, lightly refreshing brew with a fruity tartness and hint of smokiness. A second steeping at 3 minutes brought out a more herbaceous flavor with mineral (somewhat umami) tones, ending with a light bitterness, reminding me of some Japanese sencha teas. This is one of those teas that is both time and temperature sensitive. Longer or hotter brews will make it bitter and twisted... Overall, a good quality tea for a great price. Looking forward to trying other Foojoy loose teas. A classic chun mee, pretty much what I'd expect for this type of tea. Somewhat broken leaf, with a strong refreshing aroma, brews a dark cup. Dry leaf is very aromatic, smelling herbaceous and almost minty. Aroma of the brewed cup is suggestive of gingerbread and fresh herbs. This tea is tangy, but it's not the most sour example of this style of tea, which tends to be on the sour side. Although I always find Chun Mee picky about brewing temperature, I found this tea a tiny bit more forgiving than normal. Although the dry leaf did not look impressive (finely broken pieces--it looked more broken than the picture on the website suggests), I found this an above-average tea in terms of flavor. A little pricier than other Chun Mee I've tried of similar quality, but this is understandable as it is both organic and fair trade certified. I find it is possible to find organic-certified Chun Mee for cheaper (see Upton's Chun Mee Dao Ming, slightly cheaper, or the MUCH cheaper Chun Mee Moon Palace, two of my favorites) but it's hard to find anything Fair Trade certified. This struck me as an average-quality chun mee (precious eyebrows) green tea for a very low price. Not the best tea of its type that I've sampled, but certainly the best at this price point. I bought this tea in a Square tin for the pretty low price of $8 for 8 ounces, which seemed outright cheap to me. The cup is pretty aromatic, and has floral nuances. Flavor is crisp and tangy; there's quite a lot of astringency. It's important to take care in brewing; if the water is too hot, this can get harsh tasting. When brewed properly, I find this tea has a cool, refreshing quality. A good and inexpensive everyday tea, but I would prefer spending a bit more to get something a step or two up. Among Foojoy's loose-leaf offerings I prefer their Triple Cup Extra Green, probably their closest tea to this one that is superior in quality. My favorite chun mee is Upton Tea Import's Chun Mee Dao Ming, a little pricier (still cheap) but with a much more complex aroma."

            "about": "Oolong tea, sometimes written wulong, wu long or even wooloong, is a type of tea, originating in China, that has been partially oxidized and then roasted. The name translates as black dragon tea. Oolongs are occasionally called blue tea. The production process for oolongs is somewhat more involved than for black or green teas. The level of oxidation varies widely, with subjective estimates of the level of oxidation ranging from 10(percent) to 75(percent). The level of roast also varies widely, independently of the level of oxidation. Oolong can be dark in color either due to greater oxidation, or greater roast. Not all semi-oxidized teas are oolongs, see oolong-like teas below.Most oolong tea is made in China and Taiwan, although smaller amounts are produced in other countries, including India and Thailand. Oolong tea is widely consumed in China and Taiwan, and it is often served in Chinese restaurants in the United States. In China, there are three primary regions known for producing oolong. One is the Wuyi mountains in northern Fujian province, known for producing darker oolongs, often called 'Wuyi rock tea', reflecting the rocky substrates on which many of the tea plants are grown. Traditionally, most Wuyi oolongs are darker, and have a twisted shape. Anxi county in southern Fujian province is best-known for being the origin of Tie Guan Yin, and also produces numerous other types of oolong. Anxi oolongs tend to have their leaves tightly rolled into round pellets. Surrounding regions near Anxi also produce similar types of oolong. The Phoenix mountain area of Guangdong province in southern China is also important for oolongs, being the origin of dancong (single-trunk) oolong. Small amounts of oolongs are produced in many other provinces of China. The caffeine content of oolong tea varies widely. Some oolongs have very low caffeine content among teas. In general, tippy oolongs, like oriental beauty tend to be higher in caffeine, whereas oolongs made of larger leaves tend to have less caffeine. The cultivar also influences the caffeine content, so different oolongs produced by similar methods can have different caffeine levels. See caffeine content of tea for a full explanation of the factors influencing the amount of caffeine in a cup of tea. Oolong teas are very diverse and range from light, floral and vegetal greenish oolongs to richer, darker oolongs more similar to black tea, with all sorts of styles in between as well. Although it is difficult to generalize, oolong teas tend to have a more mellow flavor as compared to either green or black teas. Pouchong or bao zhong is usually considered to be the lightest (least oxidized) oolong. There are numerous darker oolongs. The level of roast in oolongs varies considerably, from very dark-roast oolongs, to oolongs with an almost imperceptible level of roast. Greener oolongs are characterized by both a low level of oxidation, and a low level of roast. The lowest level of roast is in the 'modern style' greener oolongs, which are very popular in China and Southeast Asia but less widely available in the West, which has historically preferred darker-roast and more-oxidized oolongs. Many of the modern greener oolongs have either an almost imperceptible level of roast, and may even be unroasted. It is possible for both low-oxidation and high-oxidation oolongs to have either low or high levels of roast. This variability in production process leads to a tremendous amount of diversity in the flavor, aroma, and appearance of different oolong teas. Roasted oolongs tend to have toasty or burnt flavors, often with more woody qualities, and diminished floral qualities in the aroma. Some other teas are partially oxidized but are not classified as oolongs due to a fundamentally different production process. Teas with oolong-like characteristics include darker white teas like shou mei or darker white peony tea, and lighter black teas, especially, lighter Darjeeling first flush. Yellow tea also has a slight oxidation, but it does not closely resemble oolong in flavor or aroma. Some fully-oxidized black teas, especially Chinese black teas produced from cultivars of the tea plant usually used to make oolong, can closely resemble darker oolongs. Some Pu-erh tea, particularly some aged sheng (raw) Pu-erh can resemble oolong in certain ways, reflecting the fact that the aging process produces a different type of oxidation, and a darkening of the tea leaf and mellowing of flavor.",

                "The tea that I got is packaged in individual packets, each containing six grams (about three US tea bags worth) of relatively large, but broken pieces of tea leaf. It doesn't smell as strongly as most roasted oolongs, but it also doesn't smell overly roasted as inexpensive oolongs often do. Adding water brings out a bit more aroma, but not much. It still smells like a rather mediocre roasted oolong. The flavor is both surprising and interesting. It's much stronger than I would have guessed from the nose. The initial flavor is of dark, bitter caramel and the sweetness evolves in the finish to tobacco smoke. I don't mean 'ash tray', but like the aftertaste of a quality cigar. In subsequent sips, I taste bitter cocoa and nuts. Basically, the flavor is dominated by a mellow, warm bitterness with a mild astringency. Sweetness is fleeting, but it rounds out the flavor. As I reach the end of the cup, I can taste more of the tea through the roast. I'm getting the earthy, tannic flavors that are present in certain Chinese black and cooked pu erh teas. The smokiness, though mild, has become a bit distracting by this point, but that's one of the reasons that I don't in general like roasted oolongs as much as other teas. I had a look at the spent tea leaves and didn't see any twigs or old leaves, but I also didn't see any small tips like one would expect from high quality tea. I paid $10 for 120g/4oz, so the price is about in line with the quality of the tea. ",
                "I'll confess I tried this tea after being intrigued at reading the legend of the Big Red Robe. Glad I did. I wonder if a monkey really picked this? This is my new favorite tea. It has more body and flavor than the more delicate oolong teas. I usually give it a bit more tea and a longer steep than the usual recommendation for oolongs. I go for about 2 1/2 tsp in about a 14 oz ceramic infuser cup for a full five minutes. I usually use just a little sweetener but this tastes too good as it is. Good for at least two steeps. ",
                "This tea was good, but it just didn't wow me the way I would need a tea in this price range to do in order to want to buy it. The dry leaf smells exquisite, multifaceted, and hard to describe. Although the color is dark, the smell resembles green teas in some ways. Softly toasty and bready, hinting at floral and spicy notes. The smell suggests both sweet and savory flavors. The cup is very pleasing, soft, middle-of-the-road for an oolong. The aroma of the cup isn't as interesting as I had hoped (and expected from the smell of the dry leaf). Tastes equally good hot or at room temperature, which was nice because I could be a bit lazy and let the cup cool. I found it tastes especially good when brewed stronger, using more leaf than I normally would, even for a Wuyi oolong. Resteeps well, but not exceptionally for an oolong. The spent leaf after brewing looks a lot greener than the dry leaf. I found I preferred steeping only twice. The second or later infusions have a noticeably dusty aroma, suggesting clean stone or rock. There's a very natural, outdoorsy quality I find to the second steep. I also find the later steeps to be a bit more astringent. Doesn't feel very caffeinated at all. This tea feels very neutral to me, it feels neither warming nor cooling and doesn't seem to produce much of an effect of any kind when I drink it. Pleasant, but pleasant doesn't justify the $270 a pound price tag, when I'd actually prefer drinking any number of cheaper teas, even if they were priced equally.",
                "A truly great tea! I brew this with one teaspoon of tea per cup(about 1.5 grams I think) And I get 3 steepings. The aroma is nice but indescribable, and the taste is almost the same way. It has nutty notes and is very... 'minerally'. A pretty good value at $17 per 100g but definitely not cheap either.",
                "Out of all the teas on this planet, oolong, in all its varieties, is my favorite. I received this particular type as part of the monthly deal from this company in a loose leaf form. This oolong had a nice earthy smell that was slightly stronger compared to other oolongs I have had. Its flavor was smooth all the way through with a strong, earthy taste. It had a very full flavor, and I've already drank all of it - I'm currently in the process of ordering more!"

Regardless of how it is classified, the leaf and brewed tea are both dark in color, and the tea has many characteristics in common with other Wuyi oolongs.The tea that I got is packaged in individual packets, each containing six grams (about three US tea bags worth) of relatively large, but broken pieces of tea leaf. It doesn't smell as strongly as most roasted oolongs, but it also doesn't smell overly roasted as inexpensive oolongs often do. Adding water brings out a bit more aroma, but not much. It still smells like a rather mediocre roasted oolong. The flavor is both surprising and interesting. It's much stronger than I would have guessed from the nose. The initial flavor is of dark, bitter caramel and the sweetness evolves in the finish to tobacco smoke. I don't mean 'ash tray', but like the aftertaste of a quality cigar. In subsequent sips, I taste bitter cocoa and nuts. Basically, the flavor is dominated by a mellow, warm bitterness with a mild astringency. Sweetness is fleeting, but it rounds out the flavor. As I reach the end of the cup, I can taste more of the tea through the roast. I'm getting the earthy, tannic flavors that are present in certain Chinese black and cooked pu erh teas. The smokiness, though mild, has become a bit distracting by this point, but that's one of the reasons that I don't in general like roasted oolongs as much as other teas. I had a look at the spent tea leaves and didn't see any twigs or old leaves, but I also didn't see any small tips like one would expect from high quality tea. I paid $10 for 120g/4oz, so the price is about in line with the quality of the tea.  I'll confess I tried this tea after being intrigued at reading the legend of the Big Red Robe. Glad I did. I wonder if a monkey really picked this? This is my new favorite tea. It has more body and flavor than the more delicate oolong teas. I usually give it a bit more tea and a longer steep than the usual recommendation for oolongs. I go for about 2 1/2 tsp in about a 14 oz ceramic infuser cup for a full five minutes. I usually use just a little sweetener but this tastes too good as it is. Good for at least two steeps.  This tea was good, but it just didn't wow me the way I would need a tea in this price range to do in order to want to buy it. The dry leaf smells exquisite, multifaceted, and hard to describe. Although the color is dark, the smell resembles green teas in some ways. Softly toasty and bready, hinting at floral and spicy notes. The smell suggests both sweet and savory flavors. The cup is very pleasing, soft, middle-of-the-road for an oolong. The aroma of the cup isn't as interesting as I had hoped (and expected from the smell of the dry leaf). Tastes equally good hot or at room temperature, which was nice because I could be a bit lazy and let the cup cool. I found it tastes especially good when brewed stronger, using more leaf than I normally would, even for a Wuyi oolong. Resteeps well, but not exceptionally for an oolong. The spent leaf after brewing looks a lot greener than the dry leaf. I found I preferred steeping only twice. The second or later infusions have a noticeably dusty aroma, suggesting clean stone or rock. There's a very natural, outdoorsy quality I find to the second steep. I also find the later steeps to be a bit more astringent. Doesn't feel very caffeinated at all. This tea feels very neutral to me, it feels neither warming nor cooling and doesn't seem to produce much of an effect of any kind when I drink it. Pleasant, but pleasant doesn't justify the $270 a pound price tag, when I'd actually prefer drinking any number of cheaper teas, even if they were priced equally. A truly great tea! I brew this with one teaspoon of tea per cup(about 1.5 grams I think) And I get 3 steepings. The aroma is nice but indescribable, and the taste is almost the same way. It has nutty notes and is very... 'minerally'. A pretty good value at $17 per 100g but definitely not cheap either. Out of all the teas on this planet, oolong, in all its varieties, is my favorite. I received this particular type as part of the monthly deal from this company in a loose leaf form. This oolong had a nice earthy smell that was slightly stronger compared to other oolongs I have had. Its flavor was smooth all the way through with a strong, earthy taste. It had a very full flavor, and I've already drank all of it - I'm currently in the process of ordering more!"

The second cup I brewed was pleasingly bitter, very flavorful, also with a lot of savory / umami flavor for an oolong. It's a little sour towards the bottom of the cup; I found the bitterness and savory qualities in the flavor to be more pleasant than the sourness. Very enjoyable, and a solid oolong that's on the greener side but still has a little bit of light roast. Not quite as mind-blowing as the Ruby Black from the same company though. I also thought this tea was a little pricier for what it was. This year at the festival I tried several more teas from this company, and I was pleased to say that I think their quality level has gone from solidly good, into the zone of excellence, so stay tuned for some more reviews. A lovely, smooth oolong. I brought the water to 185 (degrees)F and steeped it for a few minutes. It has a hint of herbaceousness, almost floweriness, and overall tastes like a very solid, everyday tea. I wonder how it would do if left to steep longer, as I like my teas strong. I experienced no bitterness or anything unpleasant in the taste. I'm curious about how others, those who are generally fans of oolong and those who aren't, would feel about this tea. The aroma of this oolong is very mild, not really vegetal but more like fresh vegetation growing on a spring day. It is also floral and a touch like fresh hay. Once brewed the aroma is much stronger and more floral, especially lilacs. The tea is very mild, a touch vegetal with a bit of green beans and pine needles. The tea has a very mild aftertaste and is tasty, especially if you are craving a mellow tea."

These teas were developed in Japan in the 1980's, but have begun being produced in Taiwan as well. Because they are produced primarily for their concentration of GABA, and considerations of flavor are secondary in their production, these teas often do not taste as good as other oolongs or teas in general. However, some people enjoy the peculiar flavor of these teas, which include notes of guava or other tropical fruits. The style of such teas is diverse, ranging from green to darker roasted, some having a tightly-rolled leaf style, others, long, flat leaves. Rarely, black teas using an oolong-like production style are available. GABA in the brain is known to have relaxing or anti-anxiety effects, but system-wide GABA does not generally cross the blood-brain barrier, with a few exceptions.",

                "Odd, just odd, and I didn't enjoy it very much. My first experience with GABA tea. The dry leaf of this tea looks brown, like a moderately roasted oolong, and has a faint nutty aroma with hints of gingerbread cookie dough. Upon brewing, the main thing I notice is the lack of obvious oolong aroma. The aroma is very strange. Up front, there's a quality I dislike, that I find hard to describe. Past this, the aroma is fruity, in a way completely unlike other teas. I've heard GABA oolong described as smelling like guava, and I do see the guava resemblance. There's also a suggestion of baked goods. I noticed that Nicole Martin once described a GABA tea as 'biscuity', and I see that quality in this teas as well. Astringent for an oolong, with an astringency that is similar to that of stronger black teas. The overall mouthfeel is much more like a black tea, as is the finish. I find the astringency, especially in the finish, to be unpleasant--and it certainly clashes with the commercial description of this tea, which claims a 'long lasting smooth finish'. I found the opposite, it left me with a noticeable puckering or sandpaper sensation on my palate. I did notice feeling calm after drinking this tea, but the effect wasn't particularly pronounced or dramatic, and I have no idea how much of that was psychological. This tea seems like a bit of an oddity. I can't see myself drinking it regularly because I don't like the flavor and overall experience of drinking it."

The tea is rolled very tightly and is rather dense. The dry aroma is of toasted bread and hazelnuts. I brewed this tea western-style for four minutes in water immediately off the boil. It smells lovely and though the roasted aromas are prominent, it doesn't smell smoky. The unfurled leaves are small and unbroken with almost no twigs or detritus apparent. When tasting the tea, the main notes that I get are caramel, molasses, toasted nuts and leather. The brighter notes of melon, apples and raw walnuts are pleasant, but less prominent than I would prefer. The finish is light caramel and long-lasting making for a good tea to sip and savor. It's a bit better than I expected for the price (I paid $9 for 100g, but the website lists it at $8 for 150g), but it's not really exceptional. ",

I've not had much luck with similar purchases in the past in this price range. Typically, the quality of the tea is poor or the packaging and shelf life has ruined what might have once been something nice. This was definitely a hit with me. It was vacuum sealed in a bag within a quality tin giving it a really fresh burst of aroma when I opened it up. It is a High Mountain rolled Oolong from Taiwan. The dry leaves have a very ripe fruity aroma as opposed to the strong floral essense I've experienced with some other similar Oolongs. The taste, to me, was that of overripe apples, honey and a slight bit of fermented skunkiness. The tea is a beautiful golden color. The taste is not as bold as some Taiwanese Oolongs I have tried but it is still very pleasing and I tend to prefer subtle flavors more anyway. It is easy to brew from a perspective of astringency control. I found 1 teaspoon around 190F for 4.5 minutes was my favorite. I'm really satisfied with this tea for the price I paid.

                "One of the 3 or 4 high mountain Taiwan oolongs that Music City offers. The company pretty much uses the same description for each of them, so I think a little more detail would be nice. I usually get my green oolongs from Upton, but am always on the lookout for light oolongs from other companies so gave this one a try. I like how Music City Tea offers most of their teas in a 2 ounce option, which can be just right for getting to know a tea. I'm a bit torn on these greener oolongs, and tend to prefer the more medium oxidized teas. But I do find them pleasing for certain moods. This Alishan seems to be of good quality. Little green balls with a very mild aroma in dry form. Similar to the Jade/Dong Ding/Tung Ting styles I've tried. The flavor of this one though is much more buttery than floral. I keep thinking of buttercups when I drink this :) The liquid is a pale yellow color with a butter and light honey aroma and flavor. Very gentle on the stomach, very smooth and comforting. Unfortunately it doesn't last for as many infusions as the darker oolongs unless I really fill up the gaiwan. The full leaves expand impressively and moderately quickly. I do enjoy this tea, and the lightness of flavor can be a refreshing change from some of the toastier and/or more complex oolongs. My mom loves this tea, by the way :) She frequently joins me for my gong fu style sessions. Definitely worth checking out if you enjoy a gentle and buttery cup. ",

I oversteeped this, because I forgot to set a timer and got distracted, but the tea was forgiving. There wasn't bitterness in the first cup. I added more water, and the floral was there, but there was also fairly pronounced bite. Not the tea's fault! Thanks to Angel @ Teavivre, who provided very generous samples.

The dry tea smells like green tea, but after steeping, it smells like sweet flowers, with a little bit of berry. It smells like summer! This was prepared gong fu style with just-under boiling water. First steep was 45 seconds, then 1:30, then 3 minutes. I prefer the longer infusions, but they were all great. The best infusion was at 1:30. At 45 seconds, the color was very pale yellow and the flavor was quietly floral. After 1:30, the color deepened slightly and the flavor was sweet and flowery, but without being cloying. It's hard to describe this effect, other than to say that it's perfect. I can also taste the sweet berry flavor I was smelling as the tea brewed. After 3 minutes, the tea was a golden yellow and the floral flavors were more pronounced, but were still somehow subtle. I want to drink this tea every single day. I'm currently kicking myself for not buying a larger bag, but it's a little pricey. It's absolutely worth the money, but for me, it will be saved for special occasions.

            "about": "Milky oolong or milk oolong, also known as jian xuan, is a style of oolong that has a milky aroma and a creamy and smooth quality, as if milk had been added. Milky oolongs are produced in both China and Taiwan, including in China in the Guangzhou(Quangzhou) region of Guangdong province. Different sources provide conflicting information about milky oolong. The Upton Tea Quarterly says that the unique 'milky aroma and creamy smoothness' are a result of special varietals[1], Hinas Tea claims there is a legend that it is a result of a temperature shift[2], Ten Ren claims the tea is scented with actual milk[3], and a tea blogger has claimed that the milky character is a result of artificial flavorings[4]. Tony Gebely explores these discrepancies in a post on his blog World of Tea, titled Unraveling the Mystery of Milk Oolong a bit more: Admari Teas.

The flavor of the light yellow liquor tastes like a combination of butter, cream and green oolong. Despite the very smooth texture in my mouth, an unpleasant sour note is present. Overall not a very pleasant flavor...kinda sickening in a way. So then, my first milk oolong was very odd indeed.

Milky oolongs are produced in both China and Taiwan, including in China in the Guangzhou(Quangzhou) region of Guangdong province. Different sources provide conflicting information about milky oolong. The Upton Tea Quarterly says that the unique 'milky aroma and creamy smoothness' are a result of special varietals[1], Hinas Tea claims there is a legend that it is a result of a temperature shift[2], Ten Ren claims the tea is scented with actual milk[3], and a tea blogger has claimed that the milky character is a result of artificial flavorings[4].

                "My friend gave me some of this tea to try. I'm not good at tasting the difference between different greenish oolongs. Jade oolong, four seasons, Tie Guanyin, they often taste almost the same to me. It was the same with this one at the first steeping. The second cup tasted different, though, like jade oolong but greener. It reminded me of Mao Feng green tea. I hardly even paid attention to the flavour and aroma of the third cup because that one had a really strange mouthfeel. Sometimes teas feel a bit thicker than water; Het Gouden Randje's Ban Li\u00ea`n green tea, for example. However, this one felt extremely thick and almost viscous. I couldn't quite decide if it was pleasant or not. Fourth steeping: It still feels a bit thicker than water, but not strikingly so. I'm wondering if it really was something about the tea that made it feel so strange the previous time or just something else. Anyway, it still tastes like a mix of jade oolong and mao feng. Mostly smooth but with a bright vegetal aroma as well. The colour is a lovely bright greenish yellow. Nothing new in the fifth, sixth, and seventh steepings. The eighth one has this kind of dull sweetish aroma/flavour that usually means tea leaves are spent. From here on I can still get more or less enjoyable tea from it, but I'd say seven is a very decent amount of cups from the same leaves already. I brewed this by putting a few teaspoons (about three) in a teapot, poured boiled water into the pot and then immediately poured the tea into the cup. This method works pretty well for my everyday tea. (Usually after the second or third cup, I let it steep for longer.) This is pretty expensive at (euros)7.40 for 50 grams.",
                "This tea was a disappointment and I don't recommend it. I sampled and reviewed this tea some time ago but forgot to post the review. Dry leaf consists of long, intact wiry leaves with a slightly dusty look, and smells very different from any other pouchong I've tried, an intense smell of jam or fruit preserves, like raspberry or strawberry. Underneath this aroma, which is somewhat fleeting, the leaf smells woody and toasty. Flavor is bold, but the cup disappointed me in not being as aromatic as I had hoped. Tastes a lot like generic or lower-grades of oolong. A woody aroma is dominant. Resteeps well; second cup is a little more like a typical pouchong, but still doesn't wow me. I also found a lot of leaf was necessary to get a good flavor, which makes this tea (which I already think is a bit overpriced) offer even less value. I had wanted Upton to carry a more affordable Pouchong for some time (I liked their TT92, but it was exorbitant), and I was excited to see this lower-priced offering. But I don't think it delivers the quality that I can get elsewhere--particularly from Ten Ren. Ten Ren's third grade Pouchong is significantly cheaper than this, and I like it much better: it is lighter and greener, and has floral and vegetal notes that are absent from this tea. This tea has a darker roast and I find appeals to a different aesthetic, but it struck me as more generic, not much better than the generic oolongs I can pick up in any Chinese store. So I think this one is pretty overpriced. Even among Upton's offerings, they have numerous other oolongs that are lower priced, and I think are just much better teas than this.",
                "Very soothing tea. This reminds me a lot of a tea I've tried before, but I honestly can't figure out which one. It tastes, perhaps, similar to a good milky oolong, even though that's a different kind? Silky and slightly floral, no bitterness--a great tea for sipping while relaxing. I'll update the value rating after trying a few infusions. Once brewed, I was startled by the broad, large size of the tea leaves. Hence, I suspect it'd work great for multiple infusions. UPDATE 1: You can easily get multiple infusions out of this tea, but to ensure they're the best they can be I have a few recommendations: 1) Don't steep it any longer than the first time (I went 3 minutes at 195(degrees)F). 2) Don't leave it on a warmer. 3) Make just enough for each cup, so that each one is fresh. The reason for these tips is that the tea goes from a pale green to a progressively darker brown color as the tea is continually warmed. As it does so, the flavor loses its subtlety and delicacy. It doesn't go bitter and is still notably floral, but it gains, what, astringency? I need to develop my tea vocabulary. In short, the first cup is definitely the best, but for me it's important to be careful with subsequent infusions to ensure they come out nearly as delightful as the first. UPDATE 2: Since prolonged heat seemed to be the issue for me, I tried brewing this one cold. I poured cold water into a mup, placed a strainer inside, placed the leaves in the strainer, and then set the mug in the refridgerator. This worked *really well*. From the same leaves, the tea once again tasted fresh and delicate. When the weather is warm, this makes a lovely cool drink.",
                "The aroma is intensely floral, hello notes of hyacinth, orchids, and a mellow finish of chestnuts. It is like flower nectar and mild, sweet, nuts, the aroma overall is fairly mild while also being heady. First steep starts out pretty mild, and finishes pretty mild, it is a super mellow tea without much of a presence. It has a wonderfully smooth mouthfeel, but the floral notes and sweet nectar are mild, there is a slight mineral note at the finish as well.",
                "If my heaven could exist in a teacup, I think I may have found it here. I thought this tea was phenomenal. The silky smooth mouthfeel and the orchid, honeysuckle. and vegetal tones were to. die. for. I don't think I could get enough! This tea lasts for multiple infusions; the first is by far the best, but I thought the following cups were greatly satisfying.

UPDATE 1: You can easily get multiple infusions out of this tea, but to ensure they're the best they can be I have a few recommendations: 1) Don't steep it any longer than the first time (I went 3 minutes at 195(degrees)F). 2) Don't leave it on a warmer. 3) Make just enough for each cup, so that each one is fresh. The reason for these tips is that the tea goes from a pale green to a progressively darker brown color as the tea is continually warmed. As it does so, the flavor loses its subtlety and delicacy. It doesn't go bitter and is still notably floral, but it gains, what, astringency? I need to develop my tea vocabulary. In short, the first cup is definitely the best, but for me it's important to be careful with subsequent infusions to ensure they come out nearly as delightful as the first. UPDATE 2: Since prolonged heat seemed to be the issue for me, I tried brewing this one cold. I poured cold water into a mup, placed a strainer inside, placed the leaves in the strainer, and then set the mug in the refridgerator. This worked *really well*. From the same leaves, the tea once again tasted fresh and delicate. When the weather is warm, this makes a lovely cool drink. The aroma is intensely floral, hello notes of hyacinth, orchids, and a mellow finish of chestnuts. It is like flower nectar and mild, sweet, nuts, the aroma overall is fairly mild while also being heady. First steep starts out pretty mild, and finishes pretty mild, it is a super mellow tea without much of a presence. It has a wonderfully smooth mouthfeel, but the floral notes and sweet nectar are mild, there is a slight mineral note at the finish as well. If my heaven could exist in a teacup, I think I may have found it here. I thought this tea was phenomenal. The silky smooth mouthfeel and the orchid, honeysuckle. and vegetal tones were to. die. for. I don't think I could get enough! This tea lasts for multiple infusions; the first is by far the best, but I thought the following cups were greatly satisfying. Despite the price being a little high, the quality of this tea is worth every bit. Exquisite, simply exquisite. Thank you Rishi Tea!"

                "Overall this was more run-of-the-mill than I expected for such a high-end tea. My favorite thing about it was the smell of the dry leaf, the actual cup was good, but not as interesting. The dry leaf smells incredibly beautiful...multifaceted too, lightly roasty, very fruity, like baked goods, suggesting sweetness, hints of spice. Rou Gui means 'cinnamon' and there is definitely a cinnamon note there, but it's only one quality among many, and this smells more malty and fruity than anything else. The aroma of the brewed cup isn't exactly disappointing, it's pleasant, but it neither as mind-blowing nor as complex as the dry leaf suggested. The flavor is typical for an oolong, relatively mild. Finish slightly metallic, but also very smooth. More warming than typical for an oolong. I was more a fan of the overall experience of drinking it than the smell or taste. Didn't resteep as well as I had hoped. The aroma was less complex, the cup tasted much more like a generic oolong on the second steep, and lost that magic. The second cup is also oddly acidic, tasting a little like an aged oolong that has been roasted and re-roasted. There's a pleasant softness in the roast, and the cup was both warming and clean and crisp, a combination that isn't super common among teas, but flavor-wise and aromatically, it was less interesting. Good but this is an exceptionally expensive tea...I just don't see paying this kind of price when I've been really wowed by oolongs in a much lower price range."

The use of the term 'se chung' has changed over time; it was originally a more specific term, but it has come to encompass all Anxi oolongs other than Tie Guan Yin. Different varietals usually identified as se chung oolongs include huang jin gui or golden osmanthus, mao xie or hairy crab, Benshan, Meizhan, and Qilan. These oolongs vary in level of oxidation from greener (less oxidized) varieties to darker (more oxidized). As a general rule though, the oolongs produced in Anxi tend to be greener than those produced in Wuyi. Se chung is not as well-known as other styles of Chinese oolong such as Ti Guan Yin, but it is frequently served in Hong Kong Chinese restaurants.[3] The different varieties of se chung can be quite diverse, and the style is difficult to characterize universally. Tea sold as se chung can be a blend of several of these different Anxi oolongs.[4] People posting on tea forums have suggested that the term 'se chung' has been deliberately maligned by Tie Guan Yin producers.[1,5] It is often described as an undervalued tea, very inexpensive relative to its quality. Although se chung usually refers only to teas grown in Anxi county and nearby regions, such as Yongchun, some of the se chung varietals of oolong are grown in other regions; RateTea has chosen to identify these teas as se chung oolongs, even if they are grown in other regions, such as the Wuyi mountains.

                "The reviews as well as the very low price intrigued me enough to buy a large order of this tea. I wasn't quite sure what to expect as, while mostly positive, the reviews describe a wide range of flavors. The rolled, snail-like leaf smells toasty. For some reason I expected a much greener aroma. I loaded up 5 grams into a 100ml gaiwan and proceeded to infuse 7 times using water of about 195-200 degrees. The infused liquor is a deep amber-orange-light brown. Again, I was expecting a much more light color. The aroma is very interesting and complex. After decanting from gaiwan to cup I brought the infused leaves to my nose and detected a very pleasant roasted, extremely lightly sweet, and....menthol-like aroma! This was very unexpected and not an aroma I encounter much with tea. Almost a pine or cedar aroma as well...extremely unique. The flavor is smooth, toasty and very 'warming'. I felt quite good while sipping this tea. There is a definite woody flavor. I did not detect any green, veggie or floral notes. Perhaps these would be more apparent with less leaf or a lower water temp. All 7 infusions were tasty, and the aroma from the gaiwan brought the menthol and roasted 'pine' wafting into the room. I kept sniffing the leaves as the aroma is so remarkable. I enjoyed this rather interesting oolong. In a way it reminds me of a da hong pao, but still very different. Perhaps more hojicha-like, but not exactly. In another way it reminds me of an amber oolong from Taiwan, but also very different. It's a bit difficult for me to describe the flavors and aroma I get from this very nice tea. Interesting, to say the least :) Looking forward to getting to know this tea better.

                "I thought this was a delightful tea. I have tried a Mao Xie before, and loved it, but it was an unbranded type that someone brought me back from China so I was not able to review it. This one was a lot like I remember it: pungent and a bit edgy and odd, but in a way that I liked. The dry leaf has an aroma that is complex, floral and somewhat vegetal. It reminds me of being inside a greenhouse full of tropical plants in bloom: it is somewhat orchid-like, although a little less so than some Tie Guan Yin. Upon brewing, the cup is pungent. I can see some people not liking it; the aroma is a bit edgy, heavily herbaceous and floral in a complex way. It smells almost like a mix of many different types of flowers and herbs, and the smell reminds me of late summer. It's also a bit earthy. Upon drinking, the smell gets even more complex and is both floral and earthy at the same time. It's a little bit intoxicating. The flavor is smooth, but can be bolder if you brew it stronger. Brewed lightly, the flavor is subdued, but brewing stronger I find it is very balanced, never getting too bitter or sour, although there is a slight metallic quality that some people might find objectionable. Resteeps very well for a second cup, if I start with a 2-3 minute infusion, but doesn't work quite as well for repeated steeps as some teas. The spent leaves are actually surprisingly thin for a whole-leaf oolong, and this may explain why this tea infuses more quickly. I recommend going shorter on the steeps than you may be used to for oolong. Good price too for a tea of this quality! The leaf stretches pretty far, there's a lot of flavor packed in there."

There's a peppery finish. This tea is flavorful, and in an odd way. There is a strong, but muted bitterness--rather than taking the form of a bite or kick, it's more constantly bitter throughout. I really like this tea, and it is unlike any oolong I have tried. Unfortunately, it's getting up to the pricey side at $4.50 an ounce. But comparing it to Tie Guan Yin?

There's a peppery finish. This tea is flavorful, and in an odd way. There is a strong, but muted bitterness--rather than taking the form of a bite or kick, it's more constantly bitter throughout. I really like this tea, and it is unlike any oolong I have tried. Unfortunately, it's getting up to the pricey side at $4.50 an ounce. But comparing it to Tie Guan Yin? I strongly prefer this to any Tie Guan Yin I've tried, including stuff exceeding that price. It's different, substantive, and strong."

Unlike the other Huang Jin Gui, I found that using water close to boiling, and a longer steeping time did not appreciably improve this tea.

I definitely did not enjoy this one as much as the other Se Chung oolongs from Life in Teacup, but this is still not a bad tea.

This one was a lot like I remember it: pungent and a bit edgy and odd, but in a way that I liked. The dry leaf has an aroma that is complex, floral and somewhat vegetal. It reminds me of being inside a greenhouse full of tropical plants in bloom: it is somewhat orchid-like, although a little less so than some Tie Guan Yin. Upon brewing, the cup is pungent. I can see some people not liking it; the aroma is a bit edgy, heavily herbaceous and floral in a complex way. It smells almost like a mix of many different types of flowers and herbs, and the smell reminds me of late summer. It's also a bit earthy. Upon drinking, the smell gets even more complex and is both floral and earthy at the same time. It's a little bit intoxicating. The flavor is smooth, but can be bolder if you brew it stronger. Brewed lightly, the flavor is subdued, but brewing stronger I find it is very balanced, never getting too bitter or sour, although there is a slight metallic quality that some people might find objectionable. Resteeps very well for a second cup, if I start with a 2-3 minute infusion, but doesn't work quite as well for repeated steeps as some teas. The spent leaves are actually surprisingly thin for a whole-leaf oolong, and this may explain why this tea infuses more quickly. I recommend going shorter on the steeps than you may be used to for oolong. Good price too for a tea of this quality! The leaf stretches pretty far, there's a lot of flavor packed in there."

The brewed cup is very roasty, with notes of wood and hints of coffee. It's fairly clear. Aromatically, this tea was subtle, and not as interesting as the dry leaf suggested. The fruity notes mostly vanish and it's mostly roasty. I find this tea is easily overpowered by even mild foods and it's hard to taste it unless you drink it on its own. I find when I drink it on its own it is moderate-bodied, but if I eat anything with it it tastes thin and watery. The second cup tasted aged, it was soft and mellow, and had some sort of damp and earthy aromatic notes absent from the first cup. It was pleasant, but not the sort of thing I had been expected. I have been pretty consistently disappointed with the high-end oolongs I've tried from Harney. They all seem to fit a particular aesthetic of flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel. This is a very pricey tea and it just didn't wow me. Perhaps they cater to different tastes? I think I tend to prefer oolongs with more floral notes and a lighter roast.

When water is added though it smells really quite nice...floral and honey. The brewed liquor is a deep amber color, so I expected this tea to have a decent body and flavor. But no matter how I brewed this it tasted like hot water...almost no flavor present at all. At least none detected by me. Maybe I should have tried brewing a full 15g brick in my smallest gaiwan. That would be a ridiculous amount of leaf for one tea session however and very cost prohibitive. Another thing I did not like was the large amount of thick twigs and stems. I certainly expected much better from this tea. Highly disappointing, flavorless and way overpriced. ",
                "Very dark brown leaf, rather broken up, smells mainly of roast when dry. Produces a surprisingly clear, almost-greenish infusion. Aroma complex, but only when I pay attention to it deliberately; it's not attention-getting. This tea seemed forgettable if I drank it casually, but had a lot going on when I focused on it. Aroma was mostly woody, not much roast in the actual brewed cup. Smooth flavor; very little bitterness or astringency. There's a honey-like sweetness as the cup cools. Oddly, I find the complexity comes out more when this tea is luke warm or even cold: I notice the woody tones more, there seems to be an interplay between suggestions of wood smoke, resin, twigs, and honey. The overall feel of this tea is very earthy, like the smells in a twiggy thicket in early autumn. I strongly prefer brewing this tea for a longer period of time. When brewing more strongly, there are some more interesting tones that come out, including a hint of wintergreen, one of my favorite qualities in tea. Bottom line, the price on this seemed high. I wasn't terribly impressed with this as a high-quality oolong. The leaf was more broken than the picture on the Arbor Teas website suggests. The one thing I do credit Arbor Teas with, I think their description of this tea's flavor and the experience drinking it is spot on. They say, quote: 'The taste is smooth and sweet, with a subtle dryness reminding of pear skin, followed by a lightly baked aftertaste.' Yes! I definitely get that. Spot-on description. It doesn't quite do it for me though.",
                "The dry leaf of this oolong looked and smelled heavily roasted, and frankly, smelled more than a little boring to me. But when I brewed this cup, I was pleasantly surprised. The aroma is complex and a bit edgy--there are some fairly strong skunky, herbaceous qualities, tones of celery, and a few floral tones in the background. Overall character is completely unlike Wuyi Shui Xian; I don't think I would recognize these as being from the same varietal, not comparing it to a Wuyi tea nor to the green Zhang Ping Shui Xian from Life in Teacup (which I enjoyed greatly). Similar in character to some Tie Guan Yin with a similar level of roast, but I find that the character is a little more crisp, edgy, and sharp. Although I can imagine some people might think that this oolong had more 'off' aromas than a Tie Guan Yin of comparable price, I think it is also a little more complex. Interestingly, this tea had little in common (other than appearance, origin, and price) with the green oolong from the same source. There was none of the soapy quality that I objected to in that tea, and I found this tea to be more flavorful overall, but for some intangible reason, I liked that other one better...I think it was the weaker floral qualities in the dark roast tea. Still? They're both a bit pricey, relative to their quality. I think they have more appeal as a novelty than as an everyday tea, at least to me.",
                "This was a fascinating tea for me to try. It was completely unlike any other oolong I've tried. The loosely-packed leaves separate easily and infuse quicker than I'd expect for their tough texture. After steeping I noticed that the larger leaves are mostly whole, but the smaller leaves and buds are mostly broken. If you are used to tightly-rolled greener oolongs from southern Fujian, I advise you to use a briefer steeping time for this one. Overall character is floral, but with more depth and body than is typical for greener oolongs. Color is a rich amber. Aroma is slightly soapy, but I don't mind this because there is little bitterness. First infusion was my favorite; later ones becomes a bit more sour, but still retain a good amount of flavor and aroma. As a note, the floral qualities really do strike me as smelling like narcissus. Wuyi and other darker Shui Xian that I've tried did not ever suggest this aroma to me. Usually I see Shui Xian translated as 'Water Sprite' or 'Water Fairy', but the characters also mean 'Narcissus'. As someone who loved growing daffodils (narcissus) in our garden as a kid, I recognize the smell of these flowers well, and this tea definitely has this characteristic aroma. I found this tea very interesting, although I think for this price there are a lot of greener oolongs that I like better. But since it comes conveniently in such nice little packets, I'd recommend throwing one in next time you order from Life in Teacup if you want to try something a bit unusual."

Produces a surprisingly clear, almost-greenish infusion. Aroma complex, but only when I pay attention to it deliberately; it's not attention-getting. This tea seemed forgettable if I drank it casually, but had a lot going on when I focused on it. Aroma was mostly woody, not much roast in the actual brewed cup. Smooth flavor; very little bitterness or astringency. There's a honey-like sweetness as the cup cools. Oddly, I find the complexity comes out more when this tea is luke warm or even cold: I notice the woody tones more, there seems to be an interplay between suggestions of wood smoke, resin, twigs, and honey. The overall feel of this tea is very earthy, like the smells in a twiggy thicket in early autumn. I strongly prefer brewing this tea for a longer period of time. When brewing more strongly, there are some more interesting tones that come out, including a hint of wintergreen, one of my favorite qualities in tea. Bottom line, the price on this seemed high. I wasn't terribly impressed with this as a high-quality oolong. The leaf was more broken than the picture on the Arbor Teas website suggests. The one thing I do credit Arbor Teas with, I think their description of this tea's flavor and the experience drinking it is spot on. They say, quote: 'The taste is smooth and sweet, with a subtle dryness reminding of pear skin, followed by a lightly baked aftertaste.' Yes! I definitely get that. Spot-on description. It doesn't quite do it for me though. The dry leaf of this oolong looked and smelled heavily roasted, and frankly, smelled more than a little boring to me. But when I brewed this cup, I was pleasantly surprised. The aroma is complex and a bit edgy--there are some fairly strong skunky, herbaceous qualities, tones of celery, and a few floral tones in the background. Overall character is completely unlike Wuyi Shui Xian; I don't think I would recognize these as being from the same varietal, not comparing it to a Wuyi tea nor to the green Zhang Ping Shui Xian from Life in Teacup (which I enjoyed greatly). Similar in character to some Tie Guan Yin with a similar level of roast, but I find that the character is a little more crisp, edgy, and sharp. Although I can imagine some people might think that this oolong had more 'off' aromas than a Tie Guan Yin of comparable price, I think it is also a little more complex. Interestingly, this tea had little in common (other than appearance, origin, and price) with the green oolong from the same source. There was none of the soapy quality that I objected to in that tea, and I found this tea to be more flavorful overall, but for some intangible reason, I liked that other one better...I think it was the weaker floral qualities in the dark roast tea. Still? They're both a bit pricey, relative to their quality. I think they have more appeal as a novelty than as an everyday tea, at least to me. This was a fascinating tea for me to try. It was completely unlike any other oolong I've tried. The loosely-packed leaves separate easily and infuse quicker than I'd expect for their tough texture. After steeping I noticed that the larger leaves are mostly whole, but the smaller leaves and buds are mostly broken. If you are used to tightly-rolled greener oolongs from southern Fujian, I advise you to use a briefer steeping time for this one. Overall character is floral, but with more depth and body than is typical for greener oolongs. Color is a rich amber. Aroma is slightly soapy, but I don't mind this because there is little bitterness. First infusion was my favorite; later ones becomes a bit more sour, but still retain a good amount of flavor and aroma. As a note, the floral qualities really do strike me as smelling like narcissus. Wuyi and other darker Shui Xian that I've tried did not ever suggest this aroma to me. Usually I see Shui Xian translated as 'Water Sprite' or 'Water Fairy', but the characters also mean 'Narcissus'. As someone who loved growing daffodils (narcissus) in our garden as a kid, I recognize the smell of these flowers well, and this tea definitely has this characteristic aroma. I found this tea very interesting, although I think for this price there are a lot of greener oolongs that I like better. But since it comes conveniently in such nice little packets, I'd recommend throwing one in next time you order from Life in Teacup if you want to try something a bit unusual."

            "about": "White tea, called baicha in Chinese, is a type of tea that is produced by letting the leaves wither and wilt, then drying them. Unlike green tea, white tea is not heated to kill the enzymes that cause oxidation. Although this means that white tea is less processed than green tea, the lack of heating allows some oxidation to occur, creating a slightly darker color than most green teas, and less of the vibrant green color. There is no universally accepted definition of white tea; the classification of teas as either white or green can be subjective, especially for intermediate types of tea such as snow buds (xue ya). Sometimes, white teas are classified as a sub-type of green tea, since most white teas are mostly unoxidized, but we believe that classifying them in different categories is more accurate because their production process is distinct, and because they are often more oxidized than typical green tea. Some organizations, including some tea companies, and the Tea Association of the U.S.[1], define white tea so as to only include teas including leaf tips or buds, which excludes most of the darkest-colored white teas; we do not use this definition since these teas are still minimally processed like other white teas. White tea is often described as having a very subtle and delicate aroma, but this is not always true. White teas are quite diverse, with some styles, like shou mei being rich and dark, often described as similar to oolong. Lighter white teas have aromatic notes, like melon, that are uncommon in other types of teas. White teas often lack the grassy characteristics of green teas, and they lack both the toasty character of pan-fired or baked green teas, as well as the vegetal characteristics of steamed teas. Darker white teas often have aromas resembling autumn leaves. The flavor and aromas of white teas are particularly diverse if you look at types outside the historical centers of production in Fujian province. White tea originated in China, and most of the world's white tea is produced there, a large portion of it in Fujian province, particularly, in the northern parts, including Fuding and Zhenghe. However, in recent years, due to the surging popularity of white tea, white teas have become available from numreous other regions, including India, Sri Lanka (Ceylon), Kenya, and Malawi. Some of these teas emulate traditional Chinese styles, especially silver needle, and sometimes white peony. Others, however, are novel, fitting into the broader traditions and production methods of white tea but taking on a character of their own. Many websites claim that white tea contains less caffeine than black or green teas. This is a widespread myth; the caffeine content of white teas, like other teas, varies greatly from one tea to the next. White teas with a large portion of buds, such as silver needle, tend to have more caffeine than those with a larger portion of mature leaves, as the young tips are highest in caffeine. As white teas, particularly those made exclusively of tips, are very mild in flavor, they can also be brewed very strongly, resulting in a very high caffeine content of the brewed cup. ",

                "This is only the second Moonlight White tea I've ever tried; the first was from Life in Teacup. I've had this tea for nearly two years from its harvest date, but am only reviewing it now, so I've seen how it ages slightly. It seemed to change character much more quickly than a pu-erh. The leaf is striking and unique in appearance, with leaves that are downy and silvery on one side but jet-black on the other. It arrived looking exactly like pictured on the company website. It's intensely fragrant, mainly floral but with some fruit, herbaceous and spicy notes, and hints of autumn leaves. There is a hint of the aromatic qualities of both silver needle and darker white teas like white peony or shou mei. The leaf alone smells complex. Brewing this tea produces a somewhat odd cup, very fragrant, but lighter in character. The flavor is surprisingly sweet and has little bitterness, but there's some astringency later in the sip that gives it some body. Like with the dry leaf, the aroma is complex. More spicy notes, particularly of cinnamon, come out in the brewed cup. This tea has changed somewhat since I first brewed it. Yunnan Sourcing's description says it will develop into something close to red tea, but mine hasn't gone in that direction yet. It has, however, developed more notes of autumn leaves, and the cinnamon notes in the aroma have strengthened. I think I liked the tea better when fresh. Although I like the notes of autumn leaves, the cinnamon notes are slightly jarring with the floral and fruity fragrances in the rest of the tea. Overall, I found this tea slightly easier to brew than the one from Life in Teacup. It's still a bit enigmatic, though. One thing I found tricky was that the leaf is so huge, but also so delicate, so it breaks easily, even if you're being very gentle in storing it. The small, broken pieces of leaf infuse faster and lead to a more astringent, and thus more full-bodied cup with a more potent flavor, whereas the big leaves are slower to infuse and produce a milder, clearer cup, but with greater complexity. I've served this tea to a number of people and they all seem both to enjoy it, and to appreciate its uniqueness. If you haven't ever tried this type of tea, I would recommend it, whether you know you like more full-flavored white teas, or you just want a change of pace. In the end though, I still didn't like this as much for daily drinking as most of Yunnan Sourcing's black (red) teas. As usual though, the price on this is exceptional. This is a special tea for a very reasonable price.",

                "I liked this one a lot, much more than typical for white teas. I normally don't like tippy white teas, but I was super impressed by what may be this same exact same tea, or at least a similar one, sold by Golden Tips Tea. Unfortunately, this tea is no longer in stock at either company! It is worth waiting for this tea and jumping on it if it is available from any company, because it is exquisite. Kudos to Harney for (briefly) supplying this one! The leaf of this smells fantastic, both sweet and fresh...it's intensely aromatic, first bursting with light floral and melon tones, followed by a deep, sweet, smell of fresh-baked pastries. There's a vegetal note in there peculiar to Darjeeling teas, almost like asparagus. Just the smell of the leaf is exquisite. The brewed cup adds a lot of aromas not evident just from smelling the dry leaf. Upon steeping, I notice grape, slight skunky notes. Overall it smells more like a Darjeeling black tea, such as a first flush, than like a white tea, but the color of the cup is very light. The mouthfeel is very smooth and the body very light. Flavor is sweet, slightly tangy, and low in bitterness, giving it a feel a tiny bit like a mild fruit juice. I was surprised at how different this was from the other batch of white tea I had tried from Okayti estate, that one Okayti Silver Needle Darjeeling White Tea Second Flush, sold by Golden Tips Tea. This one had more melon notes in the arom, like a typical silver needle, and lacked the cocoa and coffee notes. I initially wasn't quite as wowed by this tea, but I still really enjoyed drinking it. Resteeped really well. I liked steeping 2-3 minutes following by 15. I think the full, very long steep of 15 minutes was necessary, when I went shorter it was still a little weak, but with a long steep the second cup was very potent. I don't think I'd want to go any shorter on the first steep because it was already not super strong; this is a delicate tea, about at the delicate limit of what I tend to like, and I was using a fair amount of leaf. The second cup was a little more like a silver needle in character, but still had some of those Darjeeling-black-tea notes. Overall this tea was excellent but not quite as insanely good as the batch of a presumably similar tea I had tried from Golden Tips Tea.",
                "The aroma of the leaves is nothing short of bright and brisk! Like someone mixed up grapefruit peel, orange blossoms, wildflower honey, and lilies with a green broken vegetation undertone. It is really quite aromatic, and honestly kinda reminds me of my favorite soaps...not that this smells at all soapy, I just have a very tea smelling soap! First steeping time, the taste manages to be very clean and crisp while also being mellow and mild. It starts out with a mild lettuce and nasturtium note. This moves on to an intense sweetness of honey and scuppernongs with orange blossom and grapefruit. The finish is grapefruit and lemon verbena with a slight note of cucumber that lasts as the aftertaste. The mouthefeel is a bit dry, adding that edge of a crisp texture to a crisp taste."

You can also use our site to browse all white teas produced in Darjeeling; as of this page's last update, we only listed 2 silver needle teas not classified in the main Darjeeling white tea category. When browsing tea companies' websites to locate these teas, keep in mind that some companies list first flush white teas under the 'first flush' category.I liked this one a lot, much more than typical for white teas. I normally don't like tippy white teas, but I was super impressed by what may be this same exact same tea, or at least a similar one, sold by Golden Tips Tea. Unfortunately, this tea is no longer in stock at either company! It is worth waiting for this tea and jumping on it if it is available from any company, because it is exquisite. Kudos to Harney for (briefly) supplying this one! The leaf of this smells fantastic, both sweet and fresh...it's intensely aromatic, first bursting with light floral and melon tones, followed by a deep, sweet, smell of fresh-baked pastries. There's a vegetal note in there peculiar to Darjeeling teas, almost like asparagus. Just the smell of the leaf is exquisite. The brewed cup adds a lot of aromas not evident just from smelling the dry leaf. Upon steeping, I notice grape, slight skunky notes. Overall it smells more like a Darjeeling black tea, such as a first flush, than like a white tea, but the color of the cup is very light. The mouthfeel is very smooth and the body very light. Flavor is sweet, slightly tangy, and low in bitterness, giving it a feel a tiny bit like a mild fruit juice. I was surprised at how different this was from the other batch of white tea I had tried from Okayti estate, that one Okayti Silver Needle Darjeeling White Tea Second Flush, sold by Golden Tips Tea. This one had more melon notes in the arom, like a typical silver needle, and lacked the cocoa and coffee notes. I initially wasn't quite as wowed by this tea, but I still really enjoyed drinking it. Resteeped really well. I liked steeping 2-3 minutes following by 15. I think the full, very long steep of 15 minutes was necessary, when I went shorter it was still a little weak, but with a long steep the second cup was very potent. I don't think I'd want to go any shorter on the first steep because it was already not super strong; this is a delicate tea, about at the delicate limit of what I tend to like, and I was using a fair amount of leaf. The second cup was a little more like a silver needle in character, but still had some of those Darjeeling-black-tea notes. Overall this tea was excellent but not quite as insanely good as the batch of a presumably similar tea I had tried from Golden Tips Tea. The aroma of the leaves is nothing short of bright and brisk! Like someone mixed up grapefruit peel, orange blossoms, wildflower honey, and lilies with a green broken vegetation undertone. It is really quite aromatic, and honestly kinda reminds me of my favorite soaps...not that this smells at all soapy, I just have a very tea smelling soap! First steeping time, the taste manages to be very clean and crisp while also being mellow and mild. It starts out with a mild lettuce and nasturtium note. This moves on to an intense sweetness of honey and scuppernongs with orange blossom and grapefruit. The finish is grapefruit and lemon verbena with a slight note of cucumber that lasts as the aftertaste. The mouthefeel is a bit dry, adding that edge of a crisp texture to a crisp taste."

            "about": "Moonlight white tea or yueguang bai cha is a particular style of tea originating in China's Yunnan province. Although we classify moonlight white as a white tea, and the Chinese name contains the word white (bai), it is sometimes classified as Pu-erh, sometimes even classified as a black tea, and other times treated as a category of its own. Like oolong tea, moonlight white is a semi-oxidized tea, but its production process is fundamentally different from oolongs and it is typically not classified with them. Moonlight white is sometimes sold in compressed cakes like Pu-erh, and aged like Pu-erh, although it is also sold in loose-leaf form, and consumed sooner after production. We classify this style as a white tea because its production involves withering and drying like other white teas, and its character resembles other white teas to a large degree, although its processing differs from that of other white teas in some ways. Moonlight white is grown from a particular cultivar of the tea plant, of the long-leafed Assamica cultivar, that has leaves covered in silver hair. Because of the large leaf size and production method involving natural withering and air-drying, this tea tends to have greater levels of oxidation and thus a darker color than white teas made from smaller-leafed cultivars. The partial oxidation resulting from large leaf size and natural withering without heating is shared in common between this tea and other white teas such as shou mei and to a lesser degree, white peony. The level of oxidation, and thus the color, flavor, and aroma of this tea are sensitive to moisture levels. Dry or drought conditions will result in the leaves drying out more quickly after harvest, resulting in less oxidation, reflected in a lighter color, and a fresher and 'edgier' quality. Moister conditions, characteristic of most years, will result in a darker, smoother tea.",

                "This is only the second Moonlight White tea I've ever tried; the first was from Life in Teacup. I've had this tea for nearly two years from its harvest date, but am only reviewing it now, so I've seen how it ages slightly. It seemed to change character much more quickly than a pu-erh. The leaf is striking and unique in appearance, with leaves that are downy and silvery on one side but jet-black on the other. It arrived looking exactly like pictured on the company website. It's intensely fragrant, mainly floral but with some fruit, herbaceous and spicy notes, and hints of autumn leaves. There is a hint of the aromatic qualities of both silver needle and darker white teas like white peony or shou mei. The leaf alone smells complex. Brewing this tea produces a somewhat odd cup, very fragrant, but lighter in character. The flavor is surprisingly sweet and has little bitterness, but there's some astringency later in the sip that gives it some body. Like with the dry leaf, the aroma is complex. More spicy notes, particularly of cinnamon, come out in the brewed cup. This tea has changed somewhat since I first brewed it. Yunnan Sourcing's description says it will develop into something close to red tea, but mine hasn't gone in that direction yet. It has, however, developed more notes of autumn leaves, and the cinnamon notes in the aroma have strengthened. I think I liked the tea better when fresh. Although I like the notes of autumn leaves, the cinnamon notes are slightly jarring with the floral and fruity fragrances in the rest of the tea. Overall, I found this tea slightly easier to brew than the one from Life in Teacup. It's still a bit enigmatic, though. One thing I found tricky was that the leaf is so huge, but also so delicate, so it breaks easily, even if you're being very gentle in storing it. The small, broken pieces of leaf infuse faster and lead to a more astringent, and thus more full-bodied cup with a more potent flavor, whereas the big leaves are slower to infuse and produce a milder, clearer cup, but with greater complexity. I've served this tea to a number of people and they all seem both to enjoy it, and to appreciate its uniqueness. If you haven't ever tried this type of tea, I would recommend it, whether you know you like more full-flavored white teas, or you just want a change of pace. In the end though, I still didn't like this as much for daily drinking as most of Yunnan Sourcing's black (red) teas. As usual though, the price on this is exceptional. This is a special tea for a very reasonable price.",

                "I wasn't feeling well lately. I think I may have caught the flu, which has been going around. I tried a remedy of tea and herbs that often helps me, but it wore of quickly. So, I felt the urge to try some of this white tea, because I remember something I was told by someone regarding white tea being considered medicine at a certain point. For 5g of tea, in a 110ml gaiwan, I brewed water at 90(degrees)C, rinsed for 5 seconds, then brewed for 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45... I did a full brewing session of it, and I actually felt a lot better after. I continued on today, repeating this (the first session I did yesterday). I had better results with Nightlife than Old Whitey (I tried both). What surprised me the most was how well Nightlife aged. It used to be really, really caffeinated. But, after aging it for a while, it became a lot more mellow. The fruity notes seemed even a bit stronger. The medicinal effect was very, very welcome. I never would've suspected that white tea could have such medicinal properties. I'd been using elderberry supplements and sticking to other remedies. This is definitely the kind of thing to add to my toolbox for when the flu comes around. (Note: The 'flu' I mention was mostly in my head/sinuses, and the most strong symptom was an unbelievable amount of fatigue. I also had some sinus pressure, clogged ears, and headaches, which are uncommon for me. There was some throat congestion and nasal congestion, but it was mild. Having this white tea did help me, which makes sense, given I read that white tea has anti-viral properties. I would not recommend taking white tea if you have a sensitive stomach or are feeling nauseous, because it is caffeinated and can upset the stomach. Herbal ginger tea is better in those instances, in my experience.)",

The ball is tightly packed and I was able to get several infusions(keep in mind you can't break up the ball easily so I would use a at least 12 oz cup and fuse for 5 minutes). The aroma isn't strong but is very nice and sweet, it smells like a more faint and sweet black tea. The taste is very nice and is comparable to some of the chocolate-y black tea pearls from teavivre and adagio. Overall, I'd strongly recommend this tea to almost anyone, as I can't see anyone finding it gross."

I actually over steeped mine, for about 45 seconds witch gave it a light bitterness. I did this on purpose because I like strong teas and this is a very light flavor so to give it a bit of a stronger kick that's what I did.

This example is more like a black tea in many respects: it produces a dark-colored cup with a really rich, full-bodied character and an astringent, tannic finish. The flavor is strong and is both slightly sweet, slightly sour, and moderately bitter. The cup smells like dried fruit, autumn leaves and caramel, with a faint hint of the floral tones I encounter in some black teas. Brewed this way, I was able to make a second flavorful cup, with a long steeping. It was milder in flavor, but more aromatically complex, with more of an herbaceous character. I also tried brewing for a shorter period of time--same amount of leaf, 3 minutes. This produced a cup that was flavorful, but somewhat boring...it had a mild herbaceous smell and tasted more like green tea than when steeped longer.

It is made exclusively of leaf buds at the tips of the tea plant's branches, and contains no fully-formed leaves. On RateTea, we classify white teas produced in the style of silver needle in this category, regardless of whether or not they are labelled as such, or are of Fujian or Chinese origin. This tea is usually light in color, its aroma is subtle, and it can be quite thin. Tea drinkers preferring stronger teas can be disappointed by its delicate flavor. As buds are highest in caffeine among the parts of the tea plant, this tea tends to be high in caffeine. Some retailers mistakenly claim that this tea is low in caffeine because it is a white tea. White teas are not necessarily lower in caffeine and no generalizations can be made about caffeine content of a tea based on whether it is green, white, or black. Another tea, Junshan yinzhen, is also referred to as 'silver needle'. Junshan yinzhen is a yellow tea that is similar in many respects to bai hao yinzhen. ",

I tend not to like silver needle white teas because they're often a bit too subtle (or, put less diplomatically, bland or weak) for me, and they also seem overly caffeinated (and expensive) relative to the flavor that they deliver. This tea, while very pricey and still seemingly highly caffeinated, also had the aroma and flavor to satisfy me. The aroma is floral and very complex; there are a hint of the melon notes that I think of typical for silver needle, but there are also strong vegetal and herbaceous notes, reminding me almost of dried thyme. The flavor is rich and complex, with both sweet and bitter notes. Although astringency is moderate to low, the tea still has some body. Clean tasting but never weak, not even subtle. Resteeps exceptionally well. I brewed a second cup using a long steep, and it came out so strong that I think I probably could have spaced it out and gotten three flavorful infusions out of the leaf. Keep this in mind...it makes the high price a little more reasonable. I am eager to try more from this company. They've definitely gotten my attention with this first tea.",

It's not bad, but I have a hard time finding white teas that I really like. Also, I think I felt a slight tickle or ache at the back of my throat in response to this tea. The fuzzy tea leaves seem high quality. If you especially like pure white teas, it's worth a shot. It's not quite for me, though.",
                "If you like white teas (so pale - must steep longer.) this is a safe choice and has not only a light grassy note but I got 'flowers' - or maybe even honey if that's not reaching too far. I let it steep forever - over 5 minutes and it was still so pale, but it is, after all, a white tea. Rich in antioxidants. Like most Ito-En (Japanese) it's not too expensive and easy to find in NYC and Philly.",
                "I am a huge fan of silver needle tea, but this one was sadly disappointing. The aroma of the dry leaves is wonderfully sweet and floral. The aroma of the steeped tea, however, is almost nonexistent. The taste of the tea is as expected for a silver needle. There are notes of flowers, sweet grass, and honey. However, I found this version from Upton lacking in the complexity and sweetness I enjoy in silver needle. Yes, it tasted 'correct,' but I was left wanting just a little bit more. A little more honey. A little more floral notes. Overall a decent choice if you are already ordering from Upton (as I was), but I would personally recommend Teavivre's silver needle. I think their's is my favorite. "

Update: I've once again tried this tea and really enjoyed it. The flavor is just so smooth and calming, especially right after brewing. I have a tea kettle with a warming feature and so noticed that the flavor did change after warming for an hour or so (when I went for my second cup) and the tea was a much darker color. Not bad, but the first cup was definitely better. So it may be best to brew this one with immediate servings in mind. I also tried it with milk and thought it blended unexpectedly well. So if you like creaminess, it's worth trying that way.",
                "A delightful, light tea that tastes to me more like a delicate green tea than a white tea. I've tried two other snow buds or Xue Ya teas, and I think this is a prime example of this style. Dry leaf is coarse and hairy, silvery. Brews fairly slowly, as I'd expect for an intact, whole-leafed tea. I steeped for three minutes and the cup was very pleasant. Aroma grassy, slightly buttery, hinting at the floral and melony quality of some green teas but with none of the caramel or autumn leaf fragrance that many white teas have. If you up the temperature, more briskness comes out, which I like, but if it's too hot I find the cup tastes metallic. Arbor Teas' recommendation of 180F is about where I like it best. Try lower for a sweeter, mellower cup. I've now tried three snow buds or Xue ya teas, and this one was on par with my favorite to-date, Rishi's snow buds, which doesn't seem available on their website. The leaf looks a bit thicker than I remember that tea as, but it tasted similar and I couldn't say I preferred one to the other. I was able to brew a second cup, with a five minute steeping, and it was similar to the first, but after this, the leaves were spent. I recommend this tea to people who want a tea a little like silver needle but with the briskness and a bit of the grassy qualities of a green tea. The four ounce size is very reasonably priced for an organic tea of this quality.",

I find this to be a very grassy tea, more like green tea than white. It has a sharpness, a bite to it. The cup is quite astringent and pleasingly bitter, but the finish is sweet and has depth to it. Light in color but full-bodied. I imagine people who like white teas like silver needle or even bai mu dan might not like this one: it is strong. People who like the kick that grassy, pan-fired green teas have, but want something lighter and different, might really enjoy this one. I found Rishi's brewing instructions to be a bit off. If brewed as instructed, it is overly astringent. I used a 2 minute infusion and then made a second infusion. The second is a bit thinner but still strong, and the shorter brewing time keeps the astringency in check a bit. This is a little more expensive than Adagio's offering, and theirs is not cheap either. I think it's worth it; this one is organic, and I think it's a slightly better tea.",

I like brewing it much longer (8+ minutes) and with slightly warmer water (190-ish)...it comes out much stronger and more interesting...more grassy tones come out...more bitterness and astringency but in an enjoyable sort of way. If it's brewed this way, you only get one infusion out of the leaves, but I actually preferred this brewing method.

It is one of the most popular and widespread types of white tea. It is a common base for flavored white tea, and when companies sell only a single variety of pure white tea, it is frequently the variety offered. This tea is grown from a particular cultivar of tea plant, called D\u00e0 b\u00e1i, meaning 'big white'. The main areas of production are Fuding and Zhenghe, both in Fujian province, and each has their own distinct version of this cultivar. Teas in this style have also been produced in China in Hunan, Yunnan, and Jiangxi provinces, as well as in India, Nepal, Kenya, and Malawi. Among white teas, bai mudan tends to be darker in color, have larger leaves, and be bolder in flavor than silver needle / bai hao yinzhen, but lighter and smaller-leaved than longevity eyebrows / shou mei, reflecting an intermediate level of oxidation between these other teas. It also tends to be intermediate between these teas in caffeine levels and price. The flavor and aroma of white peony is variable, but it tends to have a floral and fruity aroma, often hinting at melon or stone fruit, sometimes with earthy notes or a suggestion of autumn leaves, but the aroma is not grassy like green teas. The flavor is mellow, but stronger than silver needle: naturally sweet, with some bitterness and a light savory (umami) flavor. Astringency tends to be low. This tea tends to be light-bodied overall, but fuller-bodied than silver needle. White peony teas from Zhenghe tend to be darker in color and have a stronger flavor and fuller body than those from Fuding. Because production outside these two main areas is more modern and experimental, there are few generalizations that can be made about the flavor of this type of tea when grown in other regions, especially those outside China. The name 'peony' can be somewhat misleading; bai mu dan is a pure tea, made only from the Camellia sinensis plant, and does not contain any peony or other flowers. The tea is named for the silvery appearance of the unopened leaf buds, which unfurl slightly in a blossom-like manner when brewed. The name references the tree peony, Paeonia suffruticosa. This tea does tend to have a floral aroma, but this may be a coincidence. White peony tea comes in different grades of fairly widely ranging price; the lower-grade tea contains more leaves and fewer buds, and are more similar to shou mei, whereas the higher-grades are more similar to silver needle or bai hao yinzhen.

                "I've had this for a few weeks now, but I've put off this review because this is my first pure white tea. The leaves were picked in April of 2016, making the tea a little over two years old as of this review. It has a gentle yet complex aroma of autumn leaves, vanilla, cinnamon, old books, and hints of flowers and spices. Brewing it at a lower temperature makes a very light and delicate cup and brings out a subtle peachy note, while brewing it with near boiling water produces a stronger cup with a flavor closer to the aroma, finishing with what oddly reminds me specifically of Forelle pears. It only resteeps once, but this isn't the kind of tea I want to drink all day anyway. I can't say if it's a typical bai mudan or compare it to any other white tea, but I really like it. It's quite a bit different from what I expected, but in a good way. It definitely won't be my last white tea (I already have a sample of Teavivre's 2012 Shou Mei on the way). ",
                "This tea is very similar to the white peony, so if you like that I'd give this a try. The flavor is what you'd expect, somewhat fruity and sweet with this white tea aftertaste that seems consistent in every white I try. I can steep this twice and it doesn't seem like too great of a value. ",
                "I thought this was an above-average white peony or bai mu dan. Dry leaf smells different from any other White Peony tea I've tried, notes of candied citrus peel, a sort of bittersweet smell, a slight pungency, almost hinting at camphor. I'm intrigued, and eager to try this to see what kind of cup this leaf produces. The brewed cup has a much more typical smell...light, floral, and slightly fresh. All the weird aromas of the dry leaf are gone, the cup smells pretty normal. Flavor is relatively bold. Although the cup is very clean tasting, and clear, and light in color, the flavor is rich and full. The only downside is a slight sourness in the finish, and perhaps a bit more lingering astringency than I'd like. These qualities were diminished by a briefer (2 minutes or less) steeping. Feels fairly caffeinated to me. Able to be resteeped, but I found if using a 3 minute first infusion, the second cup was weaker than the first no matter how long I steeped it. For this reason, and the greater smoothness, I liked a 2 minute first steep. The second cup was clean, still had some aroma, and decent flavor. Easy to drink and inoffensive, but not as satisfying as the first cup. Great price too!"

It only resteeps once, but this isn't the kind of tea I want to drink all day anyway. I can't say if it's a typical bai mudan or compare it to any other white tea, but I really like it. It's quite a bit different from what I expected, but in a good way. It definitely won't be my last white tea (I already have a sample of Teavivre's 2012 Shou Mei on the way).  This tea is very similar to the white peony, so if you like that I'd give this a try. The flavor is what you'd expect, somewhat fruity and sweet with this white tea aftertaste that seems consistent in every white I try. I can steep this twice and it doesn't seem like too great of a value.  I thought this was an above-average white peony or bai mu dan. Dry leaf smells different from any other White Peony tea I've tried, notes of candied citrus peel, a sort of bittersweet smell, a slight pungency, almost hinting at camphor. I'm intrigued, and eager to try this to see what kind of cup this leaf produces. The brewed cup has a much more typical smell...light, floral, and slightly fresh. All the weird aromas of the dry leaf are gone, the cup smells pretty normal. Flavor is relatively bold. Although the cup is very clean tasting, and clear, and light in color, the flavor is rich and full. The only downside is a slight sourness in the finish, and perhaps a bit more lingering astringency than I'd like. These qualities were diminished by a briefer (2 minutes or less) steeping. Feels fairly caffeinated to me. Able to be resteeped, but I found if using a 3 minute first infusion, the second cup was weaker than the first no matter how long I steeped it. For this reason, and the greater smoothness, I liked a 2 minute first steep. The second cup was clean, still had some aroma, and decent flavor. Easy to drink and inoffensive, but not as satisfying as the first cup. Great price too!"

                "I recently ordered some tea and bulk herbs from iherb.com. This Numi pu erh brick was novel enough that I couldn't pass it up. I'll say up front that I'm not a huge fan of shou pu erh, but I've tried enough varieties at varying price points and even found some that I enjoy that I should at least be able to tell what I'm tasting. I've had a few teas from compressed cakes ('bings'), but this is the first brick-style that I've had. The rectangular brick is packaged inside of a paper envelope, itself placed inside of a cardboard box reminiscent of baking chocolate. The packaging overall is rather similar to how bings are sold, being wrapped in paper, but otherwise exposed to the air. The envelope has a faint spicy aroma that isn't particularly tea-like that I assume is from an intermediate warehouse. In that sense, caveat emptor. One of the dangers of pu erh, even from reputable sellers, is that storage conditions during the lifetime of the tea can vary along the way to its final destination. The tea itself is almost odorless, having only a faint trace of earthy, composted hardwood leaves. The tea is rather more compressed than the others I've had. I broke off a square that weighed 4.8g and decided that I'd steep it in a mug Western-style. I tried to break the square up a bit before steeping, but only managed to break the square in half. Since I wasn't looking to grind up the leaves or anything, I left it at that. The leaves are quite broken, but have a good color and aren't quite as dark in person as marketing images appear to me (I added a closeup photo of the brick). At this point, I don't see anything that looks like dirt or twigs. It looks to me like a less-expensive lower grade, but with decent production quality. I decided to brew the tea Western-style for this first test, mainly because that's normally how I drink my tea, even pu erh. With pu erh, though, I do perform an initial fifteen-second rinse as is usually recommended. Since the water didn't seem to penetrate right away and the rinse water was barely colored, I decided to let the rinsed tea sit for a few minutes before pouring the water for the first proper steep. I steeped in a 16oz mug. I normally use 5g of tea for that much water, so the square is the perfect amount. I steeped for four minutes. After hydration, it's obvious that the leaves are even more broken than I estimated and look like they belong in a tea bag. On the other hand, the aroma is richer and more complex than I expected based on the tea's appearance. The predominant aroma is the dark, loamy earth and composted oak typical of pu erh, but there are notes of malt and hazelnuts. I'm glad I steeped four minutes rather than the recommended two. The flavor of the tea is less strong than the aroma led me to expect. It's slightly mineral and faintly malty, but both are fleeting and the mouthfeel is thin. The scent from the mug is still quite enjoyable, but doesn't translate over to how the tea tastes. I'm profoundly disappointed. One of the strengths of even cheap pu erh is the thick mouthfeel and strong flavors. This tea is extraordinarily mild, but not in a good way. Once the tea cools to lukewarm, a few more flavors come out. There's a nice peat flavor that's reminiscent of Scotch whisky along with a bit of something sweeter, like roasted carrot. Unfortunately, it's still not enough to fully rescue this tea. I'll be interested to try this tea later in a gongfu session and see if maybe an initial steep or two is more intense, but I'm not optimistic. On the positive side, this tea doesn't have any of the off flavors that are so common in badly produced or incorrectly aged pu erh. It's not fishy, moldy, or dirty smelling or tasting. Thinking about it, I'm guessing that whoever guides tea selection at Numi just likes mild pu erh. I haven't had the Emperor's Pu Erh, but the Chocolate Pu Erh is similar; it tastes wonderfully of chocolate, but not so much of pu erh. For that reason, this might actually be a good choice for someone drinking pu erh for its reputed health benefits, but isn't sold on flavor profiles involving descriptors like 'compost.' It's not for me, though. I'll certainly finish the brick and I'm sure I'll even enjoy it now with a modified set of expectations, but I'm glad that I didn't buy two or three bricks like I was originally tempted. Numi sells these bricks for $12.99, but I got the brick on sale for just under $8. That's not expensive for pu erh or even overpriced for the quality, but per gram, that means a 357g cake would cost $40-$75. That's not the 'good stuff,' but I've had other pu erh in this price range that I enjoy far more. I had such high hopes. ",
                "I ordered two of these in 2018 as it sounded from the description as the sort of thing I would like. I broke off a tiny piece initially, and as I expected it was a bit strong for my taste. I was surprised though at how quickly this one mellowed out. Now, about 5 years from harvest, I broke off a bit again and it's starting to suit my tastes more. The flavor is surprisingly sweet and savory, and the bitterness is greatly diminished. The aroma is predominately floral and slightly vegetal and fruity, with a hint of mushroomy notes and even less smoke. The overall character of it is soupy or brothy. I find this tea is quite tasty if I take care not to brew it too strongly. The finish is lightly peppery, not just in mouthfeel but even leaving a hint of a black pepper aroma. I suspect this tea would be even more to my liking if I left it to age several more years. Mainly I would like to see the stronger green-tea-like vegetal notes and peppery quality to diminish, but it is already approaching my sweet spot. The astringency has lessened more than I would expect, and I wouldn't want to lose too much of it as it already has a pretty smooth body. I also rather like how I feel after drinking this. It doesn't seem to have a lot of caffeine and it is calming to drink. This tea is no longer available, but Yunnan Sourcing sells a number of similar teas. I'm happy I purchased this and will enjoy drinking it up, probably a few years down the line.",

            "tea_type": "Pure Tea (Camellia sinensis)",
            "tea_category": "Pu-erh Tea",
            "about": "Pu-erh tea, called bo nay (or po lei, or po lai) tea in Cantonese, and sometimes spelled Puer or Pu'er, is a type of dark tea, a tea that is usually aged. Although it can be consumed immediately after production, Pu-erh is often aged, in a process called post-fermentation. This process involves active bacteria and fungal cultures. In China, post-fermented tea is also called hei cha, meaning black tea; what westerners call 'black tea' the Chinese call 'red tea'. Pu-erh comes in fully oxidized varieties (a little like black teas), called shou or shu, usually translated as ripe, ripened, or cooked pu-erh, and green varieties, called raw or sheng pu-erh. Both ripe and raw versions can be aged, but the aging is more central to the raw teas, which are produced with a very strong flavor, intended to mellow with age. Originally, only the raw version was produced; ripe Pu-erh was developed to imitate the aging process. Sheng Pu-erh is frequently aged for very long time-periods. Sheng cakes in the 10-15 year age range are often still referred to as 'young sheng'. Preferences for age and style of Pu-erh are largely a matter of personal taste. It is common for people to like only one or two of the classifications of fresh (unaged) sheng Pu-erh, young sheng, older sheng, or shou Pu-erh. Some people may find the strong flavors of fresh or young sheng to be objectionable, whereas other people find the aromatic qualities of older Pu-erh or shou Pu-erh to be unappealing. As the different ages and styles of Pu-erh can different considerably from each other, it is worth trying at least one example of the different ages and production types before drawing a conclusion about your opinion of Pu-erh as a whole. Pu-erh tea originated in Yunnan province in China. Although the term Pu-erh usually only refers to teas from Yunnan, a few other regions produce small quantities of tea in a similar style. The Su\u00f4i Gi\u00e0ng ancient tea forest in northern Vietnam, neighboring Yunnan, produces tea similar to Pu-erh. A few other regions have produced teas in the style of Pu-erh. Disputes have arisen over whether or not it is honest to label such teas produced outside of Yunnan province as 'pu-erh'. Within Yunnan, there are many important production regions. On RateTea, we classify these regions to the county level, when such information is provided by the seller. Important counties in Yunnan province include Fengqing, Menghai, Yongde, and Lancang (home of the Jing mai region). Unlike most teas which are usually sold loose, pu-erh is commonly sold both in loose and compressed forms. Pu-erh is compressed into different shapes, including bricks, cakes or disks (called bing or beeng), and a common form called tuo cha, which means bowl-shaped. These compressed teas must be broken apart prior to brewing, except for a few ones that are pressed into small single-serving shapes, like 'mini tuo cha'. Most of the highest-quality Pu-erhs, and most raw or sheng Pu-erhs are only available compressed into large cakes. Most of the loose-leaf Pu-erh on the market is ripened or cooked, and of relatively lower quality, and similarly, most of the single-serving compressed teas are also of lower quality. Tea bags of Pu-erh, with a few exceptions, are usually ripened Pu-erh. Pu-erh tea is often touted for its cholesterol-lowering properties, or for promoting weight loss. Experimental studies on rats have verified that it does lower cholesterol, by inhibiting the synthesis of cholesterol.[1][2] However, the chemicals, polyphenols, that inhibit cholesterol synthesis, GCG, EGCG, and other catechins[1], are not limited to pu-erh tea, but also occur in most types of tea, and are not necessarily highest in pu-erh. Similar results have been found for green tea.[3] Pu-erh also has also been found to have antimutagenic and antimicrobial activity.[4] However, other types of tea have these properties as well, and it has not yet been thoroughly established whether or not there are any health benefits or medicinal properties which are unique to Pu-erh. Read more about the health benefits of tea. Pu-erh can be intimidating and complex to get into. We recommend New to Pu'er? and Pu'er by Appearance: Types & Storage on bearsblog if you are interested in getting seriously into this type of tea. ",

I haven't had the Emperor's Pu Erh, but the Chocolate Pu Erh is similar; it tastes wonderfully of chocolate, but not so much of pu erh. For that reason, this might actually be a good choice for someone drinking pu erh for its reputed health benefits, but isn't sold on flavor profiles involving descriptors like 'compost.' It's not for me, though. I'll certainly finish the brick and I'm sure I'll even enjoy it now with a modified set of expectations, but I'm glad that I didn't buy two or three bricks like I was originally tempted. Numi sells these bricks for $12.99, but I got the brick on sale for just under $8. That's not expensive for pu erh or even overpriced for the quality, but per gram, that means a 357g cake would cost $40-$75. That's not the 'good stuff,' but I've had other pu erh in this price range that I enjoy far more. I had such high hopes. ",
                "I ordered two of these in 2018 as it sounded from the description as the sort of thing I would like. I broke off a tiny piece initially, and as I expected it was a bit strong for my taste. I was surprised though at how quickly this one mellowed out. Now, about 5 years from harvest, I broke off a bit again and it's starting to suit my tastes more. The flavor is surprisingly sweet and savory, and the bitterness is greatly diminished. The aroma is predominately floral and slightly vegetal and fruity, with a hint of mushroomy notes and even less smoke. The overall character of it is soupy or brothy. I find this tea is quite tasty if I take care not to brew it too strongly. The finish is lightly peppery, not just in mouthfeel but even leaving a hint of a black pepper aroma. I suspect this tea would be even more to my liking if I left it to age several more years. Mainly I would like to see the stronger green-tea-like vegetal notes and peppery quality to diminish, but it is already approaching my sweet spot. The astringency has lessened more than I would expect, and I wouldn't want to lose too much of it as it already has a pretty smooth body. I also rather like how I feel after drinking this. It doesn't seem to have a lot of caffeine and it is calming to drink. This tea is no longer available, but Yunnan Sourcing sells a number of similar teas. I'm happy I purchased this and will enjoy drinking it up, probably a few years down the line.",

            "doc": "Pu-erh tea, called bo nay (or po lei, or po lai) tea in Cantonese, and sometimes spelled Puer or Pu'er, is a type of dark tea, a tea that is usually aged. Although it can be consumed immediately after production, Pu-erh is often aged, in a process called post-fermentation. This process involves active bacteria and fungal cultures. In China, post-fermented tea is also called hei cha, meaning black tea; what westerners call 'black tea' the Chinese call 'red tea'. Pu-erh comes in fully oxidized varieties (a little like black teas), called shou or shu, usually translated as ripe, ripened, or cooked pu-erh, and green varieties, called raw or sheng pu-erh. Both ripe and raw versions can be aged, but the aging is more central to the raw teas, which are produced with a very strong flavor, intended to mellow with age. Originally, only the raw version was produced; ripe Pu-erh was developed to imitate the aging process. Sheng Pu-erh is frequently aged for very long time-periods. Sheng cakes in the 10-15 year age range are often still referred to as 'young sheng'. Preferences for age and style of Pu-erh are largely a matter of personal taste. It is common for people to like only one or two of the classifications of fresh (unaged) sheng Pu-erh, young sheng, older sheng, or shou Pu-erh. Some people may find the strong flavors of fresh or young sheng to be objectionable, whereas other people find the aromatic qualities of older Pu-erh or shou Pu-erh to be unappealing. As the different ages and styles of Pu-erh can different considerably from each other, it is worth trying at least one example of the different ages and production types before drawing a conclusion about your opinion of Pu-erh as a whole. Pu-erh tea originated in Yunnan province in China. Although the term Pu-erh usually only refers to teas from Yunnan, a few other regions produce small quantities of tea in a similar style. The Su\u00f4i Gi\u00e0ng ancient tea forest in northern Vietnam, neighboring Yunnan, produces tea similar to Pu-erh. A few other regions have produced teas in the style of Pu-erh. Disputes have arisen over whether or not it is honest to label such teas produced outside of Yunnan province as 'pu-erh'. Within Yunnan, there are many important production regions. On RateTea, we classify these regions to the county level, when such information is provided by the seller. Important counties in Yunnan province include Fengqing, Menghai, Yongde, and Lancang (home of the Jing mai region). Unlike most teas which are usually sold loose, pu-erh is commonly sold both in loose and compressed forms. Pu-erh is compressed into different shapes, including bricks, cakes or disks (called bing or beeng), and a common form called tuo cha, which means bowl-shaped. These compressed teas must be broken apart prior to brewing, except for a few ones that are pressed into small single-serving shapes, like 'mini tuo cha'. Most of the highest-quality Pu-erhs, and most raw or sheng Pu-erhs are only available compressed into large cakes. Most of the loose-leaf Pu-erh on the market is ripened or cooked, and of relatively lower quality, and similarly, most of the single-serving compressed teas are also of lower quality. Tea bags of Pu-erh, with a few exceptions, are usually ripened Pu-erh. Pu-erh tea is often touted for its cholesterol-lowering properties, or for promoting weight loss. Experimental studies on rats have verified that it does lower cholesterol, by inhibiting the synthesis of cholesterol.[1][2] However, the chemicals, polyphenols, that inhibit cholesterol synthesis, GCG, EGCG, and other catechins[1], are not limited to pu-erh tea, but also occur in most types of tea, and are not necessarily highest in pu-erh. Similar results have been found for green tea.[3] Pu-erh also has also been found to have antimutagenic and antimicrobial activity.[4] However, other types of tea have these properties as well, and it has not yet been thoroughly established whether or not there are any health benefits or medicinal properties which are unique to Pu-erh. Read more about the health benefits of tea. Pu-erh can be intimidating and complex to get into. We recommend New to Pu'er? and Pu'er by Appearance: Types & Storage on bearsblog if you are interested in getting seriously into this type of tea. Note: this was a sample included with my order. Aroma is as expected earthy/muddy strong. The liquor (5 min steep) is a very dark brown, with some purple. I would say classic Pu-erh smell. Strong boarding on dank. The taste is enjoyable and lingers on the palate. Interesting enough for me to want to investigate Pu-erh teas further. For me, Pu-erh tea seems strong enough that cream or sugar would not overwhelm the enjoyment of this tea. So, I am going to generalize with this review as there is not a lot going with this offering from Numi. After breaking the first bar piece off I actually put this in the back of my cupboard, a few years later it has resurfaced, and I decided to give it a go. No matter the water temp, steep time, serving temp (hot or cold) I just couldn't get a lot of flavor out of this blend. There is a pleasant earthy nose while still in bar format and dry. I broke up either one or even two bars into smaller pieces and brewed Western style in a teapot with brew basket in the middle, beginning with a 30 second rinse while 'waking' the leaves. I tried up to boiling hot water and my steep times ranged anywhere from 2-10 minutes. I originally bought this to get a feel for pu-er as I had a cake on order from China and didn't want to keep it if I have no taste for the tea at all. There is just no feeling to it! I couldn't pull more than a bit of mineral flavor and light earthy black tea leaf through. The aroma is pretty good so it's a shame that none of that malty body comes through once brewed. I appreciate the format but will not be buying again. One saving grace is that it is high in caffeine. Maybe I can make a light iced tea out of this with some other flavors or citrus added in for a pick me up? I would not present this to guests. I recently ordered some tea and bulk herbs from iherb.com. This Numi pu erh brick was novel enough that I couldn't pass it up. I'll say up front that I'm not a huge fan of shou pu erh, but I've tried enough varieties at varying price points and even found some that I enjoy that I should at least be able to tell what I'm tasting. I've had a few teas from compressed cakes ('bings'), but this is the first brick-style that I've had. The rectangular brick is packaged inside of a paper envelope, itself placed inside of a cardboard box reminiscent of baking chocolate. The packaging overall is rather similar to how bings are sold, being wrapped in paper, but otherwise exposed to the air. The envelope has a faint spicy aroma that isn't particularly tea-like that I assume is from an intermediate warehouse. In that sense, caveat emptor. One of the dangers of pu erh, even from reputable sellers, is that storage conditions during the lifetime of the tea can vary along the way to its final destination. The tea itself is almost odorless, having only a faint trace of earthy, composted hardwood leaves. The tea is rather more compressed than the others I've had. I broke off a square that weighed 4.8g and decided that I'd steep it in a mug Western-style. I tried to break the square up a bit before steeping, but only managed to break the square in half. Since I wasn't looking to grind up the leaves or anything, I left it at that. The leaves are quite broken, but have a good color and aren't quite as dark in person as marketing images appear to me (I added a closeup photo of the brick). At this point, I don't see anything that looks like dirt or twigs. It looks to me like a less-expensive lower grade, but with decent production quality. I decided to brew the tea Western-style for this first test, mainly because that's normally how I drink my tea, even pu erh. With pu erh, though, I do perform an initial fifteen-second rinse as is usually recommended. Since the water didn't seem to penetrate right away and the rinse water was barely colored, I decided to let the rinsed tea sit for a few minutes before pouring the water for the first proper steep. I steeped in a 16oz mug. I normally use 5g of tea for that much water, so the square is the perfect amount. I steeped for four minutes. After hydration, it's obvious that the leaves are even more broken than I estimated and look like they belong in a tea bag. On the other hand, the aroma is richer and more complex than I expected based on the tea's appearance. The predominant aroma is the dark, loamy earth and composted oak typical of pu erh, but there are notes of malt and hazelnuts. I'm glad I steeped four minutes rather than the recommended two. The flavor of the tea is less strong than the aroma led me to expect. It's slightly mineral and faintly malty, but both are fleeting and the mouthfeel is thin. The scent from the mug is still quite enjoyable, but doesn't translate over to how the tea tastes. I'm profoundly disappointed. One of the strengths of even cheap pu erh is the thick mouthfeel and strong flavors. This tea is extraordinarily mild, but not in a good way. Once the tea cools to lukewarm, a few more flavors come out. There's a nice peat flavor that's reminiscent of Scotch whisky along with a bit of something sweeter, like roasted carrot. Unfortunately, it's still not enough to fully rescue this tea. I'll be interested to try this tea later in a gongfu session and see if maybe an initial steep or two is more intense, but I'm not optimistic. On the positive side, this tea doesn't have any of the off flavors that are so common in badly produced or incorrectly aged pu erh. It's not fishy, moldy, or dirty smelling or tasting. Thinking about it, I'm guessing that whoever guides tea selection at Numi just likes mild pu erh.

Raw pu-erh is available both loose and in compressed forms, such as a tuocha cake. Raw pu-erh can be classified as both a green tea and a pu-erh tea. We list all Pu-erh as a subcategory of dark tea or hei cha for simplicity and practicality, but un-aged raw Pu-erh is usually more accurately classified as a green tea.",

                "Half-litre pot at home, brewed from a tuocha, i.e. a pill of compressed fermented leaves. Pours nearly clear fudge brown with negligible brownish sediment. Clear aroma of tea leaves, with mild notes of fermentation. Bitter, but not aggressive, flavour of black tea, with leafy notes and barely discernible touches of fermentation, much milder than in the aroma. Rough and slightly astringent palate. Not bad, but I expected something more pronounced, especially in the aroma. The tea company's website and the staff at its local retailer in my hometown say that the brewing should take four minutes. I tried that but the effect was mediocre - barely any aroma, let alone taste. I doubled the brewing time then and it worked. A mild but not unenjoyable cup. A little pricey, though (5 DKK for a single tuocha). I tried adding half a teaspoonful of sugar to my second cup and the result was not bad, either.

                "SECOND UPDATE: I'm pretty sure now that this tuo is counterfeit and not really from the Xiaguan factory. I'd been drinking leaves from the surface, which were good, but just broke through to a second layer of chopped up leaves and twigs. I'm rather surprised at the amount of effort that went into counterfeiting a tea that isn't particularly expensive to start with. This is definitely a young sheng (raw) pu-erh and that's really about all I know about this tea. I'd yet to try sheng pu-erh (young or old), so when I saw it in an Asian, mom-and-pop grocery for $4, I had to try it. There's no date anywhere on the package, so I've no idea what year it's from, but it can't be very old because the tea is still really green and it was too cheap to have been aged. So far, all of the pu-erh teas that I've tried have been shou pu-erh, so I really didn't know what to expect. The unwrapped tuo smells faintly grassy and has a hint of seaweed like Japanese green teas. The compacted tea was denser than I expected. I used a butter knife to try to flake pieces off, but it really took some force to break pieces off. I weighed the tea as I broke it off (10 grams for a 32 ounce pot) and it didn't look like enough, but it expanded a lot when brewed. After breaking the pieces off, the pieces and the broken surface of the tuo smelled strongly of grass, seaweed and alfalfa. I treated it as green tea and brewed it western-style with 180(degrees) water for four minutes. The brewed tea reminds me strongly of inexpensive gunpowder greens. It's spicy, smoky, and vegetal. There are notes of raw broccoli and spinach. Some medicinal notes while the tea was hot seemed to disappear as the tea cooled. I suspect those may be more volatile flavors that were preseved by compressing the tea so tightly that are normally lost in loose styles. It's pleasantly bitter, but not as bitter as I'd expected from online descriptions of young sheng pu-erh. It's novel and flavorful as a green tea, but I can understand how aging might improve it. I brewed the tea a second time at 190(degrees) for five minutes. The tea has almost as much color this time as the first. It's not as pungent as the original brewing, but still has enough aroma and flavor to be pleasant. Most of the spiciness and bitterness are gone, but it's still grassy and refreshing. The tuo is 100g of tea (I weighed it to be 98g), so it was a little over $1 per ounce. Judged as a green tea, I'd say that it's on par with, or a bit better than other teas in that price range. Since I'm not looking to age tea myself, I probably won't buy another one. UPDATE: I'm really enjoying this tea. As I've progressed through the tuo, I've improved my technique for breaking apart the tea and can now get decent-sized flakes with mostly whole leaves. I've also been trying with varying temperatures of water and have to say that I prefer hotter (boiling) water to steep the tea. This tea is much more caffeinated than other teas. Also, multiple steeps keep delivering flavor as the tea hydrates. I'm on my fourth western-style, five-minute steep and the flavor is just starting to weaken. The first three were all more flavorful than the first steep of most green teas. I bought two more tuos. Not because I intend to age them, but I expect to drink them sooner rather than later.",
                "I'd rate this one pretty high, but most of the flavor is in the breath, not in the taste itself. I think it's a matter of personal preference as to whether one prefers one, the other, or both. I prefer both because it gives more of a rounded experience. This just doesn't have enough in the taste to appeal to me. There is a delectable mouthwatering sensation. It's one of the strongest of all the teas that I've had. There's some astringency, but it settles out very evenly when the mouthwatering quality sets in. The bitterness here is stronger than in other teas. I'd call it pointed because it's not a blanketed quality, but when it peaks in the mouth, it's quite strong. I actually don't enjoy it. I prefer something softer. There is something of a sugary note but it's not in the forefront. It may come out more prominently after aging, but I've had mixed results with that particular note when aging teas. It's not one that I find very reliable when it comes to sticking around. The fruity note in the breath is something that I think may develop more over time, and it is a delicious note. But, it's not a taste at this point, and even the sensation in the breath isn't very strong. Even though this is the more expensive of the two, I opted to purchase a cake of Fengqing Ancient Tree Spring Chun Jian Raw Pu-erh Tea Cake (2012) instead. I just preferred the fact that there was more presence in the taste itself, as opposed to the breath. I don't think that the Xi Gui is a bad tea, but I think that it would benefit from more time, while the Fengqing Ancient Tree Spring Chun Jian is one that I find delicious right now. The Fengqing Ancient Tree Spring Chun Jian is one year older, but in my experience aging raw pu-erh, one year doesn't make enough of a difference to explain the divide here. I think the leaves used for the Xi Gui are just rougher to start. They may result in a more refined tea later on, but for the time being, I don't find it as enjoyable as the Fengqing Ancient Tree Spring Chun Jian. (As a note, I've brewed all my samples of the Xi Gui (I had more than two that I purchased) using the Eastern method directions provided by TeaVivre.)"

Since I'm not looking to age tea myself, I probably won't buy another one. UPDATE: I'm really enjoying this tea. As I've progressed through the tuo, I've improved my technique for breaking apart the tea and can now get decent-sized flakes with mostly whole leaves. I've also been trying with varying temperatures of water and have to say that I prefer hotter (boiling) water to steep the tea. This tea is much more caffeinated than other teas. Also, multiple steeps keep delivering flavor as the tea hydrates. I'm on my fourth western-style, five-minute steep and the flavor is just starting to weaken. The first three were all more flavorful than the first steep of most green teas. I bought two more tuos. Not because I intend to age them, but I expect to drink them sooner rather than later. I'd rate this one pretty high, but most of the flavor is in the breath, not in the taste itself. I think it's a matter of personal preference as to whether one prefers one, the other, or both. I prefer both because it gives more of a rounded experience. This just doesn't have enough in the taste to appeal to me. There is a delectable mouthwatering sensation. It's one of the strongest of all the teas that I've had. There's some astringency, but it settles out very evenly when the mouthwatering quality sets in. The bitterness here is stronger than in other teas. I'd call it pointed because it's not a blanketed quality, but when it peaks in the mouth, it's quite strong. I actually don't enjoy it. I prefer something softer. There is something of a sugary note but it's not in the forefront. It may come out more prominently after aging, but I've had mixed results with that particular note when aging teas. It's not one that I find very reliable when it comes to sticking around. The fruity note in the breath is something that I think may develop more over time, and it is a delicious note. But, it's not a taste at this point, and even the sensation in the breath isn't very strong. Even though this is the more expensive of the two, I opted to purchase a cake of Fengqing Ancient Tree Spring Chun Jian Raw Pu-erh Tea Cake (2012) instead. I just preferred the fact that there was more presence in the taste itself, as opposed to the breath. I don't think that the Xi Gui is a bad tea, but I think that it would benefit from more time, while the Fengqing Ancient Tree Spring Chun Jian is one that I find delicious right now. The Fengqing Ancient Tree Spring Chun Jian is one year older, but in my experience aging raw pu-erh, one year doesn't make enough of a difference to explain the divide here. I think the leaves used for the Xi Gui are just rougher to start. They may result in a more refined tea later on, but for the time being, I don't find it as enjoyable as the Fengqing Ancient Tree Spring Chun Jian. (As a note, I've brewed all my samples of the Xi Gui (I had more than two that I purchased) using the Eastern method directions provided by TeaVivre.)"

After that I was a little worried about buying shou that wasn't even a year old, but I had heard a lot of good things about White2Tea, so I took a chance. I was glad to find out that both Old Reliable and this bonus mini cake lacked the unpleasant fishy, wet dirt odors and could be enjoyed immediately. Still, I waited a few days before brewing this, since I only had one mini cake. It mostly smelled like wood, with a clean earthy aroma in the background. I put the whole mini cake in my gaiwan, rinsed twice, then started brewing. It had a smooth woody and earthy taste and moderately thick mouthfeel, just like it's described on the website. Later infusions just got thinner rather than changing noticeably. I think it would probably be best brewed western style. I don't see any benefit to using a gaiwan with this tea. I can only compare it to White2Tea's Old Reliable and some Rishi pu-erh with questionable storage (the tea shop I bought it from sold it as 'aged', but from my understanding, properly stored aged shou shouldn't have any wet or fishy odors left).

                "Half-litre pot at home, made from inch-long thin handrolled leaves - they look like tiny sticks. Pours clear light straw (against white china) with no sediment. Clear aroma of tea (yellow, to be sure, but the scent is not very different from that of green or white), with a faint touch of peach. Delicate bitter flavour reminiscent of pure white tea, just with a touch of fermentation. Mild palate, low on tannin, with only little astringency and some smooth touches. Tastes good as is, but a small amount of sugar (a quarter of a teaspoonful) definitely does not do it any harm, either. This is my first pure yellow tea and the experience is quite positive. I am looking forward to tasting more specimens of the style. Not the cheapest pleasure but not very expensive, either and worth the money (55 DKK per 100 g). 7 4 4 72 12 g / l; 80 C; 4 min.

Unfortuantely, while this particular tea is GOOD and has a near-excellent value, it isn't GREAT. I steeped 2.5g at 190F for 3 minutes.This tea is known for being mild in flavour yet even with this standard I found it to be somewhat dull. A resteeping under the same settings had a reversal of an effect; the tea was now too astringent and tannic for my liking. However, like my other instances with Jun Shan Yin Zhen I find more than 2 cups gives me a long-lasting energy and focus that, whilst not intense, was definitely prevalent roughly an hour after my last cup. In short, I like how this tea makes me feel and find it to be a useful functional food."

Another in a remarkably large selection of green/black mixtures from Murchie's, CBC Radio Blend stands up well to all the rest by comparison, and is fine on its own. They appear to have mastered the difficult art of green/black blending, and it shows here. As with most (not all!) of their green/black selections, part of the green tea used is jasmine-infused. That element shows up nicely in the dry-bag and in-cup aromas. The website states that, in addition to jasmine, the tea sports 'a touch of citrus'. I don't detect that in the aroma or direct flavor, but maybe my tongue is a bit unrefined and crude (as people have told me for unrelated reasons). However, I absolutely detect a lemon-orange essence in the aftertaste, of all things. It's pleasant, and I wish I could pick it up more in the flavor, which is solidly jasmine-dominated. A better balance of jasmine and the same citrus as in the aftertaste would be rather alluring to drink. Even as it stands, this is a wonderful green-black blend if you like jasmine.

No. 22 Blend is yet another in a growing arsenal of green/black blends Murchie's sells, and whose difficult blending art they seem to have mastered. As with most such teas, the steeping balance between too delicate for black and too bitter for green is a relatively narrow window of time and temperature, but the attention to both tea quality and flavor balance (bergamot and a lesser level of jasmine) makes it work. This seems fairly tolerant of some oversteeping or hotter/black-tea temperatures; though the bitterness grows over time, it's slow, and takes a long time to get cloying. It also seems to gain more flavor, more quickly, than most other black/green blends for short steeps. Either way, a really nice, uncommon floral/fruity essence shines through consistently at every step, from scent (wonderful in dry-bag form, sniffing inside the packaging), through taste to aftertaste. Yet the rich flavors of the base teas still are quite apparent. I have no substantive complaints, and only have half a star off the aroma since it's just a little more subdued than the taste.

Does that violate the 'spirit' of the brand? ;-) Library is a green-black mix, one of quite a large inventory of such blends sold by Murchie's.

At various times within the same cup, I get some of the passing smooth flavor of a well-grown black tea, a little of the grassy/mossy/vegetal character of a good green, a tolerable level of astringency, a mild but definite jasmine taste and aroma at all times, and even with extended steeping, not much bitterness. This would be a good experience for fanciers of delicate tea, I suspect, if steeped on the short end. But when steeped long, it doesn't make you regret that. Normally I do prefer more potent teas. However, I'll give this blend high marks for its excellent taste, flavor balance, and its forgiveness of steeping mistakes by the chugger. Let me elaborate on the latter. Because this isn't a very intense nor thickly bodied tea, I steeped it several minutes once on purpose after the more-normally brewed (for a green/black blend) first cup. There was almost no difference. Another time, I got distracted, accidentally left the bag in for 15 minutes or more, and had to reheat the cup. I thought that would ruin it, make it taste like bitter cough medicine or some such...but hardly! It was much the same, still. So yes, this is a very forgiving tea. The dry-bag aroma is quite pleasing: a grassy/jasmine mix that is neither weak nor overbearing, but steady. The wet bag loses some (not all) of the jasmine, and offers a more algal or mossy scent, but again, mildly so, not offputting."

                "I commend White2Tea for the attempt at combining white tea with black tea in a cake like this. It was an interesting experiment. But, while the taste really isn't bad, the effect it has on me is very uncomfortable. That also hasn't changed over the years (I've had this cake for a while and have been aging it and periodically give it a taste again). I can't say from personal experience (because I've never done this), but I imagine that mixing a quadruple shot of espresso with sedatives would feel like this. It's just all over the place. The taste is not nearly nice enough to compensate, and the flavor does not last nearly as long as a white compressed tea does on its own. It actually doesn't last as long as a black tea on its own, either. This is one of those cases where combining two otherwise great things has somehow reduced the resulting value of them, simply due to that combination. Black tea alone is great, white tea alone is great...but together? It's less like peanut butter and jelly and more like peanut butter and sardines. If you're curious, get a sample. If I could do my order over, I'd get a sample instead. I never would've ordered a whole cake of this if I'd known it would be like this. It was an interesting tasting experience, though. So, like I said, I'd recommend the sample if you're curious.",
                "Has an aroma of a mellow note of roasted cashewnut. The liquor is of dark copper color and tastes flowery and light. This is a common favorite in our collection and one of my 'go-tos'.",
                "I really like this tea. I found that it varies noticeably depending on how much of each tea (white or black) is used to make a cup. I actually like it when one of the two dominates but the minority tea adds complexity to the majority one. Both are high quality, so whether you prefer white or black tea this one is worth a shot. I heated this tea at 185(degrees)F and got several strong cups out of it.",
                "I was genuinely surprised at how well this blend worked. I was also surprised at how much the overall character was like a white tea, in spite of there being more black tea and the leaf itself looking very dark. Black and white tea blends are such a strange idea, and so hard to execute, and Teakruthi's teas have been consistently so good that I becaume eager to try this one out of sheer curiousity. The aroma is fruity, floral, and with a good bit of wintergreen, very pleasing. The second thing I noticed though, was that it was very difficult to spoon out or portion out this tea because the two different types of leaf are quite different in shape. Although both are long and wiry, the white tea has much broader leaves whereas the black tea is more tightly rolled. I had to do a bit of work with a teaspoon to ensure I was getting a good mix or balance of the two and I'm still not sure if I did. I sort of get the sense that if I took a big bag of this stuff and shook it up, it might separate, with the white tea ending up on top and the black tea at the bottom. All this said, when I brewed this tea, it blended perfectly. The aroma is fruity, floral, and sweet, and almost hints at bubblegum, with notes of wintergreen and cinnamon. Although the leaf looks like much more black tea than white, somehow it seems totally balanced. I think the black tea itself is very mellow and floral, making it mesh well with the aromas and flavors of the white tea, without overpowering it. Finishes with a light astringency. Resteeps well, better actually than some white teas. I always made two cups. Easy to brew too, it wasn't at all picky about steeping time or temperature. 3 minutes was good on the first cup.

            "doc": "This category is for teas that are a blend of black tea and white tea but contain no other ingredients. Such blends are very uncommon, as the strong flavors and aromas of black tea tend to overpower white teas, which tend to be on the delicate side. However, balanced blends of black and white tea are possible, especially with smoother black teas that tend to have less bitterness and astringency.I commend White2Tea for the attempt at combining white tea with black tea in a cake like this. It was an interesting experiment. But, while the taste really isn't bad, the effect it has on me is very uncomfortable. That also hasn't changed over the years (I've had this cake for a while and have been aging it and periodically give it a taste again). I can't say from personal experience (because I've never done this), but I imagine that mixing a quadruple shot of espresso with sedatives would feel like this. It's just all over the place. The taste is not nearly nice enough to compensate, and the flavor does not last nearly as long as a white compressed tea does on its own. It actually doesn't last as long as a black tea on its own, either. This is one of those cases where combining two otherwise great things has somehow reduced the resulting value of them, simply due to that combination. Black tea alone is great, white tea alone is great...but together? It's less like peanut butter and jelly and more like peanut butter and sardines. If you're curious, get a sample. If I could do my order over, I'd get a sample instead. I never would've ordered a whole cake of this if I'd known it would be like this. It was an interesting tasting experience, though. So, like I said, I'd recommend the sample if you're curious. Has an aroma of a mellow note of roasted cashewnut. The liquor is of dark copper color and tastes flowery and light. This is a common favorite in our collection and one of my 'go-tos'. I really like this tea. I found that it varies noticeably depending on how much of each tea (white or black) is used to make a cup. I actually like it when one of the two dominates but the minority tea adds complexity to the majority one. Both are high quality, so whether you prefer white or black tea this one is worth a shot. I heated this tea at 185(degrees)F and got several strong cups out of it. I was genuinely surprised at how well this blend worked. I was also surprised at how much the overall character was like a white tea, in spite of there being more black tea and the leaf itself looking very dark. Black and white tea blends are such a strange idea, and so hard to execute, and Teakruthi's teas have been consistently so good that I becaume eager to try this one out of sheer curiousity. The aroma is fruity, floral, and with a good bit of wintergreen, very pleasing. The second thing I noticed though, was that it was very difficult to spoon out or portion out this tea because the two different types of leaf are quite different in shape. Although both are long and wiry, the white tea has much broader leaves whereas the black tea is more tightly rolled. I had to do a bit of work with a teaspoon to ensure I was getting a good mix or balance of the two and I'm still not sure if I did. I sort of get the sense that if I took a big bag of this stuff and shook it up, it might separate, with the white tea ending up on top and the black tea at the bottom. All this said, when I brewed this tea, it blended perfectly. The aroma is fruity, floral, and sweet, and almost hints at bubblegum, with notes of wintergreen and cinnamon. Although the leaf looks like much more black tea than white, somehow it seems totally balanced. I think the black tea itself is very mellow and floral, making it mesh well with the aromas and flavors of the white tea, without overpowering it. Finishes with a light astringency.

Green and black tea blends are uncommon for a variety of reasons. One reason is that green tea is most common in the tea culturen of China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, whereas black tea in most common in the tea culture of India and Western countries. Another barrier to creating these blends is that most black teas taste best when brewed with boiling water and taste bland if the water is not hot enough, whereas many green teas taste best when brewed with water well below boiling, and will taste bitter or harsh if the water is too hot. Our guide on brewing temperature for tea explains more about this issue. In order to effectively blend green and black teas such that they can be brewed well, both teas must be chosen that perform well when brewed at the same temperature. This can be achieved either by choosing black teas that work well at lower temperatures or green teas that can be brewed with hotter water, or achieving a balance between the two.",

                "This tea was blended originally in 1996 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, though I don't think CBC markets it directly. Murchie's website touts, 'choice Ceylon and China black teas, Jasmine and other green teas with a touch of citrus'. Another in a remarkably large selection of green/black mixtures from Murchie's, CBC Radio Blend stands up well to all the rest by comparison, and is fine on its own. They appear to have mastered the difficult art of green/black blending, and it shows here. As with most (not all!) of their green/black selections, part of the green tea used is jasmine-infused. That element shows up nicely in the dry-bag and in-cup aromas. The website states that, in addition to jasmine, the tea sports 'a touch of citrus'. I don't detect that in the aroma or direct flavor, but maybe my tongue is a bit unrefined and crude (as people have told me for unrelated reasons). However, I absolutely detect a lemon-orange essence in the aftertaste, of all things. It's pleasant, and I wish I could pick it up more in the flavor, which is solidly jasmine-dominated. A better balance of jasmine and the same citrus as in the aftertaste would be rather alluring to drink. Even as it stands, this is a wonderful green-black blend if you like jasmine. Others with better-refined tasting skills may appreciate it even more.",
                "Murchie's promotes this as a more robustly flavored version of their No. 10 Blend, which I reviewed very favorably in 2019, and I agree. So I'll give it a few more points. The component teas are: GREEN: Jasmine and gunpowder BLACK: Keemun and Ceylon, with some bergamot. No. 22 Blend is yet another in a growing arsenal of green/black blends Murchie's sells, and whose difficult blending art they seem to have mastered. As with most such teas, the steeping balance between too delicate for black and too bitter for green is a relatively narrow window of time and temperature, but the attention to both tea quality and flavor balance (bergamot and a lesser level of jasmine) makes it work. This seems fairly tolerant of some oversteeping or hotter/black-tea temperatures; though the bitterness grows over time, it's slow, and takes a long time to get cloying. It also seems to gain more flavor, more quickly, than most other black/green blends for short steeps. Either way, a really nice, uncommon floral/fruity essence shines through consistently at every step, from scent (wonderful in dry-bag form, sniffing inside the packaging), through taste to aftertaste. Yet the rich flavors of the base teas still are quite apparent. I have no substantive complaints, and only have half a star off the aroma since it's just a little more subdued than the taste. Addendum: I inadvertently left half of a big cup of No. 22 Blend sitting out on the porch on a cool night. Resulting conclusion: this would make a good iced tea too.",
                "Murchie's developed this blend to commemorate their 125th anniversary (1894-2019), and I hope it sticks around. A blind taste test might elicit a reaction like this: 'Really nice black tea blend, but I can't quite place this interesting flavor it has under that.' The black tea solidly dominates the green in dry-bag aroma, in-cup smell, in-cup flavor and wet-bag aroma. [Curiously, the wet bag, which fortunately is the least important of my rating elements except when absolutely outstanding, has a rather muddy aroma in this case.] For some cups I've needed to put conscious effort into teasing out the gunpowder tea's element from the prevailing flavor. Another way to advertise this would be, 'a classic blend of black teas with a touch of green'. Mainly I pick up the latter at the end of the sip and in aftertaste. The good news is that the black assortment used-Assam, Keemun, Ceylon, and Yunnan-is very well-balanced, smooth, and devoid of any offputting flavor elements on its own. Anniversary Blend is a full-bodied brew, though not quite as much as a couple of their jasmine-infused green/black offerings. Importantly to the distraction-prone and forgetful among us, it forgives oversteeping better than the great majority of teas I've ever tried. This blend takes very well to sweetening, as I've noticed with a lot of teas containing at least some Assam. My wife, normally not a big fan of most green teas nor green/black blends, like this one even more than I, and insists on making it a part of our regular 'Murchies runs' (major mail orders a time or two a year). For U.S. buyers, the continuing favorable $CAD/$USD exchange rate makes this and most Murchie's offerings excellent values for teas of such good quality, especially at larger quantities (such as 100-bag boxes). ",
                "Murchie's touts Library Blend as the ideal tea to sip while reading a good book-hence the name. Instead I chugged three of several cups so far while watching a live-streamed volcanic eruption. Does that violate the 'spirit' of the brand? ;-) Library is a green-black mix, one of quite a large inventory of such blends sold by Murchie's. This one contains Ceylon, Keemun, Jasmine green, and Gunpowder styles. As such, it's more complex than the similar (and quite good!) No. 10 Blend, but not as strong. I gave it the same total rating, albeit for somewhat different reasons. At various times within the same cup, I get some of the passing smooth flavor of a well-grown black tea, a little of the grassy/mossy/vegetal character of a good green, a tolerable level of astringency, a mild but definite jasmine taste and aroma at all times, and even with extended steeping, not much bitterness. This would be a good experience for fanciers of delicate tea, I suspect, if steeped on the short end. But when steeped long, it doesn't make you regret that. Normally I do prefer more potent teas. However, I'll give this blend high marks for its excellent taste, flavor balance, and its forgiveness of steeping mistakes by the chugger. Let me elaborate on the latter. Because this isn't a very intense nor thickly bodied tea, I steeped it several minutes once on purpose after the more-normally brewed (for a green/black blend) first cup. There was almost no difference. Another time, I got distracted, accidentally left the bag in for 15 minutes or more, and had to reheat the cup. I thought that would ruin it, make it taste like bitter cough medicine or some such...but hardly! It was much the same, still. So yes, this is a very forgiving tea. The dry-bag aroma is quite pleasing: a grassy/jasmine mix that is neither weak nor overbearing, but steady. The wet bag loses some (not all) of the jasmine, and offers a more algal or mossy scent, but again, mildly so, not offputting.",
                "Have you ever walked into the lobby of a tire shop, and noted its distinctive aroma of freshly manufactured tire rubber? That was my immediate impression of the taste/scent blend upon drinking this tea, and I can't shake it. It's as if someone liquefied that air in a tire store, and stirred it into a tea. The website says, 'This is a blend of some of Queen Victoria's favourite teas that were delivered by our founder, John Murchie when [Her Royal Majesty] was in residence at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.' Back in Victoria's day, there weren't many rubber tires; if she did enjoy such a tea, she couldn't have made the unfortunate association I did: memories of big times at Big O... The dry-bag scent was rather strongly smoky, and admittedly I'm not a fan of smoky tea. This rises off the Lapsang Souchong, which here is blended with Darjeeling and Ceylon varieties and then jasmine-scented. Yet Murchie's refers to it as Green-Black tea on the packaging. So I suppose there's an unmentioned green tea (or the Darjeeling is green?) tossed in there somewhere too? Confusing...but then again, confusion is a state of mind I seem to occupy a lot. I can taste the base tea, and it seems to be decent quality, but the blend here just doesn't work for me. The way the smoke and tea melded together really brought to mind tire rubber. B.F. Goodrich, Firestone, Michelin, or Pirelli? You tell me. I don't lick tires. Outside the cost, it's hard to put a pleasant spin on this tea, which barely treads water and, given my 'General' high regard for Murchie's teas, was a deflating experience not befitting a good year. I'll spare you any more bad puns. The jasmine scent is very faint in-cup, somewhat more in the wet bag after most of the smoke-dominant flavor washed out. If you like smoky teas, maybe your impression will be better than mine. This was part of a variety pack, and I'm not going to be ordering it on its own."

                "This is one of my favorite decaf teas. Like all Celestial Seasonings teas, the stringless, tagless, square tea bags are connected in pairs and are not wrapped. The box has an inner package of waxed paper to keep the tea fresh until the package is opened, but I always move the tea bags to an airtight container after opening. The dry tea bags contain chopped up tea the size of fannings and smell like dry grass. Adding the water produces a medium-dark, green-amber liquor. The aroma isn't as strong as most caffeinated green teas, but it's complex, reminding me of light oolongs. Since the tea is decaffeinated, I find that brewing the tea with cooler water like normal results in a weak cup, so I use boiling water like I would for black tea. The tea is labelled as a green-white mix and I can taste a fair amount of what is probably shoumei white tea, giving the tea a distinctive flavor. The initial sensation is bittersweet, giving way to a mellow, but robust richness that again reminds me of greener oolong teas. The finish is long and reminiscent of apricots. This tea compares favorably with other grocery store green teas, even caffeinated ones. When I have to drink decaf, this is one of my staples. It's typically about $3.50 for a box of 20 tea bags.",

It's subtle, but definitely there. It's a light tea that blends green and white quite well. For the price, I can say I'd buy it again! This is one of my favorite decaf teas. Like all Celestial Seasonings teas, the stringless, tagless, square tea bags are connected in pairs and are not wrapped. The box has an inner package of waxed paper to keep the tea fresh until the package is opened, but I always move the tea bags to an airtight container after opening. The dry tea bags contain chopped up tea the size of fannings and smell like dry grass. Adding the water produces a medium-dark, green-amber liquor. The aroma isn't as strong as most caffeinated green teas, but it's complex, reminding me of light oolongs. Since the tea is decaffeinated, I find that brewing the tea with cooler water like normal results in a weak cup, so I use boiling water like I would for black tea. The tea is labelled as a green-white mix and I can taste a fair amount of what is probably shoumei white tea, giving the tea a distinctive flavor. The initial sensation is bittersweet, giving way to a mellow, but robust richness that again reminds me of greener oolong teas. The finish is long and reminiscent of apricots. This tea compares favorably with other grocery store green teas, even caffeinated ones. When I have to drink decaf, this is one of my staples. It's typically about $3.50 for a box of 20 tea bags. So surprised by how good this tea is for the cheap, cheap price (A box of 24 bags was $2.99 in my local supermarket). Very light & mild - innocuous flacvor - and I needed a quick fix for a parent/teacher meeting - so this was perfect. Not gourmet, not fancy, not a holy grail - but for a cheap teabag it's one of the best I've tried in a long while. I like the simplicity of this tea, but was ultimately underwhelmed. It lacks any distinct or robust flavors. "

A more accurate term is spiced chai. Masala chai is a drink made by brewing tea, usually black tea, together with spices. Often, but not always, milk and sweetener, such as honey or sugar, are added. Sometimes condensed milk is used. If the milk is steamed, as with an espresso machine, the result is called a 'chai tea latte'. Typically, masala chai is mixed up at the time of brewing, adding spices to taste, although, especially in the U.S., it is also sold pre-blended in teabags. A few companies sell green or herbal teas in a similar style to masala chai. RateTea lists all pre-blended masala chai mixtures in this category. However, you can make your own spiced chai by blending spices with tea. For a classic flavor, try starting with an Indian black tea such as Assam. Traditional Indian masala chai is diverse and varies regionally and based on personal taste. Spices most commonly used include cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, star anise, peppercorn, and cloves. Other spices, herbs, and flavorings, such as nutmeg, rose, liquorice, vanilla, or mint are occasionally used. When only one spice is used, the resulting blend is usually named with the spice itself, such as cinnamon black tea or tea with cardamom: the term 'chai' is usually reserved for blends including multiple spices. Black tea blended with cardamom, or 'cardamom tea' is widely consumed in the Middle east.",

The aroma and flavor aren't quite as potent as a few of their other fruit and berry teas, such as black currant, coconut and raspberry (haven't tried their lemon tea yet since I'm not a big lemon fan, and strawberry because...I don't know). Still, the apricot aroma rises cheerfully from the dry packaging upon opening, and from the cup upon steeping.

Looking deeper into the ingredients, it makes sense: calendula and elder-flower petals decorate the mix as well. I let about half my first cup get cold, thanks to getting distracted and forgetting about it, and discovered that this would make an absolutely splendid iced tea...indeed, better even than hot, with the fruit flavor turning a naturally sweet, smooth, creamy tone. Indeed, despite ordering this with our usual late-fall run, we have decided to have only a very occasional hot bag, and save most of it for iced tea this coming summer.

                "Another 'conference tea' here...I had a couple bags there, and brought another home to steep in boiling well water. Water quality at the meeting was good, so my impressions were consistent in both places. The best part of this tea was its dry-bag smell: potent, high-quality bergamot, but still not too much to overpower the aroma of tea. I wish the in-cup scent and flavor were that luscious! The in-cup aroma was somewhat offputting, with little bergamot and a distinct character of soggy, musty, harvested grain that has been left in storage too long. I haven't been drinking stale beer out of my tea cup either, so it wasn't the cup! With one outstanding aroma, and one rather poor one, the 'aroma' rating overall fell into mid-ranges. I sweeten my tea rather strongly, but a good deal of bitterness still came through. The brew darkens quickly and is very tannic also, perhaps due to the fine chopping of the leaves, but also the use of a natively dark and bitter tea. Sweetening makes it tolerable, but I can see how this tea would be uncomfortably bitter for some. The good news is that the flavor brings back much of the bergamot, and none of the moldy sensation I got from simply sniffing the liquid. The aftertaste has a bit of a cooling effect, best reflecting some astringency arising from the bergamot oil. Oddly, the wet-bag aroma didn't have mustiness either; it was rather bland, faintly tea-like and weakly bergamot-bearing. ",
                "This is quite a tasty and well-conceived blend, novel yet nice in both aroma and flavor, holding its own in those departments with any herbal/black bagged combination out there. However, I wish it were stronger, more befitting its name. The rectangular, stringless tea bags are small, about half the volume of Celestial Seasonings or Murchie's bags of similar design (but larger dimensions). My suggested solution, therefore, is simple: use bags like CS does, and add a commensurate volume of the same ingredients. Then price that more reasonably, and this could be a major hit. The first ingredient is orange pekoe (black tea), followed by orange peel, rose hips, coriander, cinnamon, ginger, rosemary, and star anise. The main components that jump out of the dry-bag scent are the cinnamon and orange, reminiscent of a Christmas tea, but the flavor brings the licorice-like quality of star anise out vividly. Coriander and ginger come out best in the aftertaste, with anise and orange still there. I won't be running 30 to 50 miles as a messenger between settlements, as the box claims this beverage helped tribal warriors to do, but I will recommend dropping two bags into a large cup to optimize the experience of this blend. Unfortunately that will drag further on the value, which already was marginal, considering I paid around $3 retail for a cubic box of just 12 teabags at the Mount Rushmore gift shop. ",
                "I actually like this one. It isn't as good as loose-leaf tea would be, but for a tea bag it's nice. I brewed the water to 205(degrees)F and let the bag steep under one of those Primula hats for several minutes. Both black tea and peach were present in the strong flavor, but it didn't go bitter. Usually, black tea of fannings goes bitter for me very easily. The aroma is actually a bit floral, too, which is nice. I could definitely see getting this regularly for when the convenience of a teabag is needed, especially for while at work. This was, for me, one of the better inexpensive, flavored black tea bags I've had. That said, the second cup wasn't as strongly flavored as the first."

I had been drinking it with milk and sugar, but I decided to try lemon, and that works out well -- mild vanilla and lemon are a good combination. Another 'conference tea' here...I had a couple bags there, and brought another home to steep in boiling well water. Water quality at the meeting was good, so my impressions were consistent in both places. The best part of this tea was its dry-bag smell: potent, high-quality bergamot, but still not too much to overpower the aroma of tea. I wish the in-cup scent and flavor were that luscious! The in-cup aroma was somewhat offputting, with little bergamot and a distinct character of soggy, musty, harvested grain that has been left in storage too long. I haven't been drinking stale beer out of my tea cup either, so it wasn't the cup! With one outstanding aroma, and one rather poor one, the 'aroma' rating overall fell into mid-ranges. I sweeten my tea rather strongly, but a good deal of bitterness still came through. The brew darkens quickly and is very tannic also, perhaps due to the fine chopping of the leaves, but also the use of a natively dark and bitter tea. Sweetening makes it tolerable, but I can see how this tea would be uncomfortably bitter for some. The good news is that the flavor brings back much of the bergamot, and none of the moldy sensation I got from simply sniffing the liquid. The aftertaste has a bit of a cooling effect, best reflecting some astringency arising from the bergamot oil. Oddly, the wet-bag aroma didn't have mustiness either; it was rather bland, faintly tea-like and weakly bergamot-bearing.  This is quite a tasty and well-conceived blend, novel yet nice in both aroma and flavor, holding its own in those departments with any herbal/black bagged combination out there. However, I wish it were stronger, more befitting its name. The rectangular, stringless tea bags are small, about half the volume of Celestial Seasonings or Murchie's bags of similar design (but larger dimensions). My suggested solution, therefore, is simple: use bags like CS does, and add a commensurate volume of the same ingredients. Then price that more reasonably, and this could be a major hit. The first ingredient is orange pekoe (black tea), followed by orange peel, rose hips, coriander, cinnamon, ginger, rosemary, and star anise. The main components that jump out of the dry-bag scent are the cinnamon and orange, reminiscent of a Christmas tea, but the flavor brings the licorice-like quality of star anise out vividly. Coriander and ginger come out best in the aftertaste, with anise and orange still there. I won't be running 30 to 50 miles as a messenger between settlements, as the box claims this beverage helped tribal warriors to do, but I will recommend dropping two bags into a large cup to optimize the experience of this blend. Unfortunately that will drag further on the value, which already was marginal, considering I paid around $3 retail for a cubic box of just 12 teabags at the Mount Rushmore gift shop.  I actually like this one. It isn't as good as loose-leaf tea would be, but for a tea bag it's nice. I brewed the water to 205(degrees)F and let the bag steep under one of those Primula hats for several minutes. Both black tea and peach were present in the strong flavor, but it didn't go bitter. Usually, black tea of fannings goes bitter for me very easily. The aroma is actually a bit floral, too, which is nice. I could definitely see getting this regularly for when the convenience of a teabag is needed, especially for while at work. This was, for me, one of the better inexpensive, flavored black tea bags I've had. That said, the second cup wasn't as strongly flavored as the first."

For a mass-marketed brand commonly available in retail stores, this rendition holds its own, but better quality can be had.

However, the brewed cup curiously lacks much aroma, and is far fainter than the dry-bag scent. The wet-bag aroma smells more like highly diluted Lysol floor cleaner. So across the olfactory timeline, one goes from excellent to very poor. Fortunately the last step holds little weight in the ratings, since people generally don't buy tea to sniff the wet bag. Taste-wise, however, it's a pretty good tea, more of a vanilla black tea with a hint of bergamot...smooth and naturally a little sweet. This makes the sweetened version very much so, which I like, but the overall flavor could use a couple more notches on the intensity meter. Another oddity I encountered here is that the flavor was strongest in the aftertaste, with a little more of the bergamot coming through.

Speaking of the wet bag, it's worth a good sniff or two, or dozen. This is where the lavender comes out best, almost like a potpourri of lavender, vanilla and faint orange, with about 15 lavender flower buds visible in-bag.

            "about": "Earl Grey tea is a black tea flavored with oil from the peel of the bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia). The tea is named after Charles Grey, a prime minister of the UK who was a member of the Whig party. Most Earl Grey tea is made, as it was historically, with black tea, typically a Ceylon. Recently, as green and black teas have increased in popularity, green and white varieties have also become available. This style has even inspired Earl Grey rooibos, a caffeine-free herbal blend produced by substituting rooibos for tea. Earl Grey tea has a strong and distinctive aroma that renders it easily recognizable as its own style, regardless of what variety of tea is used as a base. Many different varieties of black tea are used as the base for this tea. The amount of bergamot oil used also varies widely, ranging from blends where bergamot dominates the aroma to teas with only a hint of bergamot. Earl Grey tea is a favorite of Captain Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Although tea enthusiasts generally know that Earl Grey is flavored with the Bergamot orange, deeper knowledge of this variety of orange is not common in the world of tea. The Bergamot orange is likely a hybrid of Citrus limetta (Mediterranean sweet lemon) and Citrus x aurantium (Bitter orange), which is itself a hybrid.[1] This orange is mostly cultivated in south Italy, mostly concentrated in a very small stretch of land in Reggio Calabria. Other regions of production include Ivory Coast, southern France, and Antalya Province of Turkey. For Earl Grey tea production, the peel of the orange is pressed and the essential oil extracted; this oil is then used to flavor tea. The fruit flesh itself is used in marmalade, and the juice is used for medicinal purposes, but not drunk as a beverage. The bergamot orange is not closely related to the 'bergamot' plants (Monarda sp.), 'wild bergamot', 'Oswego tea', or 'bee balm', which are all native to North America and in the mint family. These plants, however, have a very similar aroma, and make excellent herbal teas. These herbs can also be blended with black tea to yield a flavored tea closely resembling Earl Grey tea. The variety on the right, Monarda didyma, is sometimes called Scarlet Bergamot for its scarlet blooms. This species was used as a substitute for black tea following the Boston Tea Party.[2] Earl Grey is a black tea and thus has similar effects on health to other black teas. However, oil of bergamot also has other bioactive properties and may have other health benefits. Although it has not been extensively studied, some preliminary research shows that it may have neuroprotective effects, protecting the brain against damage caused by a chemical known to damage neurons.[3] Like other citrus though, it may cause photosensitivity. Bergamot also contains one of the compounds responsible for grapefruit drug interactions, so it may also cause similar interactions. ",

                "This is the second loose-leaf Earl Grey I've had from Murchie's, and an outstanding example of the type, especially for someone like me who likes a bold, assertive tea. It is made from Assam, Keemun and Yunnan, and you bet the Assam asserts itself boldly in all phases of taste and aroma. Upon opening the bag, the dry scent does what you'd expect from a well-crafted EG: an unmistakable stream of bergamot, but not so intense that the tea also doesn't smell great on its own. In fact, *both* are strong, with neither dominating the other, and I could sniff this stuff all day. At some point, however, one ought to steep and drink! A lot of golden tips populate the dry leaves, and this seems to make the brewed cup deliver a good kick of caffeine that won't leave one drowsy or lacking energy. I don't know which of the tea components (or all?) provide most of the golden tips, but it works. The combination delivers enough bitterness and astringency to communicate that this is no delicate beverage, but is kept under control by the malty sweetness of the Assam they use. The Assam is quite evident, and its scent reminds me a lot of a high-quality molasses. So there's a natural sweetness here too, that adding sweetener enhances very pleasantly. If any of the elements were this strong individually without the others to balance them, this tea might turn off some folks; however, it's robust everywhere and in good balance. This is one of my favorite loose teas of all, so far, and certainly atop the Earl Grey ranks. Murchie's regular Earl Grey was excellent also, but very different in sourcing: Ceylon, Keemun and Darjeeling. Earl's Gold didn't get as dark, as fast, as Earl Grey, but was a notch richer, and also, smooth yet strong in-cup, so I'm rating this one just a tick higher on the RateTea meter. I think they're both well worth a try for fans of robust, loose-leaf EG teas-especially connoisseurs who probably could tease out all manner of notes that seemingly should arise from such different geographic origins.

                "The round, tagless tea bags are packed into a sealed mylar pouch, but aren't individually wrapped. The freshly opened pouch smells of bergamot, but isn't as fruity as Williamson's Duchess Grey. The bergamot has an aroma that is present in the Duchess Grey, but otherwise unique to Willamson. It's fruity, but almost has a berry-like note to it that I don't notice in other Earl Greys. The tea itself is CTC black tea from Kenya. The tea and bergamot flavors are nicely balanced. The tea has a medium astringent, but is quite bitter. The maltiness isn't as heavy as in Assam teas, but can be tasted through the bergamot. The flavor isn't complex, but is nice. I paid $4.99 at a TJ Maxx, which is slightly more than the $4.50 at Williamson's website, but without the international shipping. The price is comparable to other UK and Irish brands with which it favorably competes and Williamson has been easier to find locally. It's comparable in quality to Bigelow and Twinings, which are easier to find, but I prefer Williamson's stronger and more bitter flavor profile.",

The dry tea looks like CTC granules that have been further crumbled. It has a nice bergamot aroma. The brewing tea smells of bergamot, but there's little contribution from the tea itself. This carries through to the first sip. The bergamot flavor is nice, but though not particularly strong, it completely buries the tea flavor. After the tea has cooled a bit, there's a hint of malty bitterness, but just a hint. It's inoffensive, but mediocre.

I'm pretty sure that the citrus in Twinings Earl Grey is a blend. The bergamot is pronounced (as it should be in an Earl Grey), but I also taste sweet orange and grapefruit. The tea itself is mild. I can taste a bit of maltiness under the citrus, but it's thin-bodied with almost no bitterness or astringency. I prefer Earl Grey made with more flavorful tea. As the tea cools, the fruit flavor and aroma intensify to a nice fruitiness. A mild bitterness also appears at the sides of the tongue. Twinings is comparable in quality to Bigelow, which I slightly prefer, but is a little bit more expensive. Its main selling point is that it's easy to find in a grocery store. There are many brands available online, both bagged and loose, that are higher quality and better tasting. "

            "doc": "Earl Grey tea is a black tea flavored with oil from the peel of the bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia). The tea is named after Charles Grey, a prime minister of the UK who was a member of the Whig party. Most Earl Grey tea is made, as it was historically, with black tea, typically a Ceylon. Recently, as green and black teas have increased in popularity, green and white varieties have also become available. This style has even inspired Earl Grey rooibos, a caffeine-free herbal blend produced by substituting rooibos for tea. Earl Grey tea has a strong and distinctive aroma that renders it easily recognizable as its own style, regardless of what variety of tea is used as a base. Many different varieties of black tea are used as the base for this tea. The amount of bergamot oil used also varies widely, ranging from blends where bergamot dominates the aroma to teas with only a hint of bergamot. Earl Grey tea is a favorite of Captain Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation. Although tea enthusiasts generally know that Earl Grey is flavored with the Bergamot orange, deeper knowledge of this variety of orange is not common in the world of tea. The Bergamot orange is likely a hybrid of Citrus limetta (Mediterranean sweet lemon) and Citrus x aurantium (Bitter orange), which is itself a hybrid.[1] This orange is mostly cultivated in south Italy, mostly concentrated in a very small stretch of land in Reggio Calabria. Other regions of production include Ivory Coast, southern France, and Antalya Province of Turkey. For Earl Grey tea production, the peel of the orange is pressed and the essential oil extracted; this oil is then used to flavor tea. The fruit flesh itself is used in marmalade, and the juice is used for medicinal purposes, but not drunk as a beverage. The bergamot orange is not closely related to the 'bergamot' plants (Monarda sp.), 'wild bergamot', 'Oswego tea', or 'bee balm', which are all native to North America and in the mint family. These plants, however, have a very similar aroma, and make excellent herbal teas. These herbs can also be blended with black tea to yield a flavored tea closely resembling Earl Grey tea. The variety on the right, Monarda didyma, is sometimes called Scarlet Bergamot for its scarlet blooms. This species was used as a substitute for black tea following the Boston Tea Party.[2] Earl Grey is a black tea and thus has similar effects on health to other black teas. However, oil of bergamot also has other bioactive properties and may have other health benefits. Although it has not been extensively studied, some preliminary research shows that it may have neuroprotective effects, protecting the brain against damage caused by a chemical known to damage neurons.[3] Like other citrus though, it may cause photosensitivity. Bergamot also contains one of the compounds responsible for grapefruit drug interactions, so it may also cause similar interactions. Another 'conference tea' here...I had a couple bags there, and brought another home to steep in boiling well water. Water quality at the meeting was good, so my impressions were consistent in both places. The best part of this tea was its dry-bag smell: potent, high-quality bergamot, but still not too much to overpower the aroma of tea. I wish the in-cup scent and flavor were that luscious! The in-cup aroma was somewhat offputting, with little bergamot and a distinct character of soggy, musty, harvested grain that has been left in storage too long. I haven't been drinking stale beer out of my tea cup either, so it wasn't the cup! With one outstanding aroma, and one rather poor one, the 'aroma' rating overall fell into mid-ranges. I sweeten my tea rather strongly, but a good deal of bitterness still came through. The brew darkens quickly and is very tannic also, perhaps due to the fine chopping of the leaves, but also the use of a natively dark and bitter tea. Sweetening makes it tolerable, but I can see how this tea would be uncomfortably bitter for some. The good news is that the flavor brings back much of the bergamot, and none of the moldy sensation I got from simply sniffing the liquid. The aftertaste has a bit of a cooling effect, best reflecting some astringency arising from the bergamot oil. Oddly, the wet-bag aroma didn't have mustiness either; it was rather bland, faintly tea-like and weakly bergamot-bearing.  This is the second loose-leaf Earl Grey I've had from Murchie's, and an outstanding example of the type, especially for someone like me who likes a bold, assertive tea. It is made from Assam, Keemun and Yunnan, and you bet the Assam asserts itself boldly in all phases of taste and aroma. Upon opening the bag, the dry scent does what you'd expect from a well-crafted EG: an unmistakable stream of bergamot, but not so intense that the tea also doesn't smell great on its own. In fact, *both* are strong, with neither dominating the other, and I could sniff this stuff all day. At some point, however, one ought to steep and drink! A lot of golden tips populate the dry leaves, and this seems to make the brewed cup deliver a good kick of caffeine that won't leave one drowsy or lacking energy. I don't know which of the tea components (or all?) provide most of the golden tips, but it works. The combination delivers enough bitterness and astringency to communicate that this is no delicate beverage, but is kept under control by the malty sweetness of the Assam they use. The Assam is quite evident, and its scent reminds me a lot of a high-quality molasses. So there's a natural sweetness here too, that adding sweetener enhances very pleasantly. If any of the elements were this strong individually without the others to balance them, this tea might turn off some folks; however, it's robust everywhere and in good balance. This is one of my favorite loose teas of all, so far, and certainly atop the Earl Grey ranks. Murchie's regular Earl Grey was excellent also, but very different in sourcing: Ceylon, Keemun and Darjeeling. Earl's Gold didn't get as dark, as fast, as Earl Grey, but was a notch richer, and also, smooth yet strong in-cup, so I'm rating this one just a tick higher on the RateTea meter. I think they're both well worth a try for fans of robust, loose-leaf EG teas-especially connoisseurs who probably could tease out all manner of notes that seemingly should arise from such different geographic origins.  The round, tagless tea bags are packed into a sealed mylar pouch, but aren't individually wrapped. The freshly opened pouch smells of bergamot, but isn't as fruity as Williamson's Duchess Grey. The bergamot has an aroma that is present in the Duchess Grey, but otherwise unique to Willamson. It's fruity, but almost has a berry-like note to it that I don't notice in other Earl Greys. The tea itself is CTC black tea from Kenya. The tea and bergamot flavors are nicely balanced. The tea has a medium astringent, but is quite bitter. The maltiness isn't as heavy as in Assam teas, but can be tasted through the bergamot. The flavor isn't complex, but is nice. I paid $4.99 at a TJ Maxx, which is slightly more than the $4.50 at Williamson's website, but without the international shipping. The price is comparable to other UK and Irish brands with which it favorably competes and Williamson has been easier to find locally. It's comparable in quality to Bigelow and Twinings, which are easier to find, but I prefer Williamson's stronger and more bitter flavor profile. Benner English Breakfast is ALDI's regular 'premium' offering. This Earl Grey is a periodic special. The tea bags are packaged in individual cellophane pouches. The dry tea looks like CTC granules that have been further crumbled. It has a nice bergamot aroma. The brewing tea smells of bergamot, but there's little contribution from the tea itself. This carries through to the first sip. The bergamot flavor is nice, but though not particularly strong, it completely buries the tea flavor. After the tea has cooled a bit, there's a hint of malty bitterness, but just a hint. It's inoffensive, but mediocre. At $2.19 for 20 tea bags, it's somewhat less expensive than Bigelow or Twinings, but also not quite as good. The dry tea is finely chopped and smells strongly of citrus. There are a few white flecks in the bag that according to the ingredients are probably bergamot peel. I'm pretty sure that the citrus in Twinings Earl Grey is a blend. The bergamot is pronounced (as it should be in an Earl Grey), but I also taste sweet orange and grapefruit. The tea itself is mild.

Lemon flavoring for black and other teas can also be achieved with other herbs, including lemongrass, lemon balm, lemon verbena, or lemon myrtle.

            "doc": "Black tea is often flavored with lemon. This is achieved in many different ways. Commonly, like pictured on the right, the tea is brewed and then a slice of lemon is squeezed to add lemon juice before drinking the tea. Adding lemon juice to black tea changes the chemical composition of the tea, making it lighter in color and reducing its bitterness. Some tea is packaged and sold with lemon flavoring added; this can be done by flavoring the tea leaves with the essential oil of lemon, or it can be done by including dried pieces of lemon peel in with the tea leaves. Lemon flavoring for black and other teas can also be achieved with other herbs, including lemongrass, lemon balm, lemon verbena, or lemon myrtle. These herbs can also be combined with each other or with actual lemon flavoring. These different plants, although unrelated, actually have the same family of chemicals, although in different relative proportions. Their aromas are slightly distinct, but all are lemony.One-litre pot at home, made from a mixture of leaves of black tea (Assam?) and pieces of lemon peel, all organic and sprinkled with natural flavour.

Not really bad, though, just very different from a typical scent of a Chinese tea. The taste is a little bitter and strong on the first few sips. After that, though, I found its qualities to be quite smooth, being both somewhat bitter and somewhat sweet. It is quite full bodied and opaque, which is a bit unusual for this type of tea.

It can also be produced by adding the essential oil or extract of rose to black tea. Rose black tea may or may not contain actual rose petals; the petals are more of a decorative element as the flowers can impart a strong aroma to the tea even if they have been removed. However, blending loose rose petals with tea can be a good way to add a strong rose aroma as well. Rose hips, the fruit of the rose plant, rich in vitamin C, are also commonly used in herbal teas, but some rose black teas and other flavored teas contain rose hips as well. In contrast to flowers such as jasmine and osmanthus which are often described as delicate and perfume-like, rose can have a surprisingly bold aroma. And like these other floral teas, other types of teas scented with rose, such as rose green tea, tend to bear more resemblance to each other than this tea does to other black teas.",

They don't seem artificial to me, despite the presence of some artificial flavorings. However, the taste itself was more obviously off from what I'd expect from vanilla extract or vanilla-bean pieces, as some higher-quality teas use. Perhaps the artificial flavoring is more water-soluble, whereas the natural part (extract's essential oil or natural ester) is more amenable to evaporation onto the air (scent). I'm just speculating based on my increasingly fuzzy recollections of manufacturing vanilla ester in chemistry class. Or I stayed at Holiday Inn Express. :-) I did detect the base-tea flavor under a heavy load of vanilla flavoring, but it was very plain and featureless.

            "about": "Flavored green tea is green tea that has been flavored with various ingredients. On RateTea, we list flavored green teas separately from pure green teas, which are listed in their own category. Because of the distinct qualities of green tea, green teas are typically mixed with different flavorings from those used in black tea. Some flavorings, such as lemon or mint, are common with both types of tea. More recently, green Earl Grey has also become more popular. Common traditional flavorings for green tea include fruit, toasted rice (genmaicha), flower petals (rose or jasmine), or ginseng. High-quality flavored green teas typically include flavorings that are well-chosen to blend or harmonize with the characteristics of a carefully chosen base tea. Both Chinese and Japanese-style teas can be used as a base. Because of the tremendous diversity in the different styles of green tea, different teas blend best with different flavorings and ingredients. When buying loose-leaf flavored green tea, we recommend looking at the different offerings that a company has, and seeing if they all use the same base tea. Companies with lower-quality teas will often use a single base tea and flavor it with different extracts. Companies can also use flavorings to mask lower-quality tea and thus generate a higher profit margin. We recommend seeking out blends where the flavorings are balanced with, rather than overpowering, the base tea.",

I got this at a Wingate by Wyndham motel in Frisco, TX, drinking some there and saving a couple others to try later. The bag came in a sealed foil-paper pouch, so it held a nice dry-bag aroma that was vegetal: mildly grassy and a little reminiscent of celery or uncooked collards. The flavor was mellow but pleasant, not watered-down or tinny as a lot of store brands, food-service greens, or even Lipton can be. While not of utmost quality, it holds its own comparably against some of the common name-brand tea bags often used in catering and conference service, such as Stash, Tazo or Bigelow, and richer than Twinings.

                "My experience with genmaicha is very limited, and it's not my favorite tea type, so take this for what it's worth in that context. If the dry smell alone were the basis for evaluating a tea, I would have launched this stuff into the compost heap, untasted, with prejudice. Maybe I'm just not well-adapted to genmaicha teas. Still, the dry-bag smelled nothing like any sort of tea I've had, but instead, old rice cakes left out in the sun too long, with a hint of burned popcorn. The tea (sencha) was hard to detect at that stage, though plenty of chopped green tea leaves could be seen in the bag, mixed with little nuggets of toasted rice around 1-3 mm in width. Fortunately the flavor was a lot better! Indeed, this was the rare tea that tasted much more pleasant than the dry aroma. The liquid brewed up a yellow-green color, with flavor very well-balanced between toasted (not burned) rice, popcorn, and a really nice sencha tea that takes well to artificial sweetener. Normally brewed, it was noticeably, but not unpleasantly, astringent, and decidedly vegetal (of course!). It tolerates oversteeping too, based on an accidental then deliberate experiment of up to 8 minutes, with slightly murkier and darker color, but seemingly no more astringency nor excess bitterness. The aftertaste does get a little weird: still astringent, surprisingly bitter, and a bit algal. The wet bag aroma loses all the burned or smoky character of the dry bag, but gains some musty or moldy aroma the dry bag didn't have. I have read that good genmaicha tea is expensive, but as of this writing, Murchie's Canadian price converts to around US$10 for a 50-bag box. I suspect that folks who do appreciate genmaicha a lot would enjoy this tea overall more than I have, but I'll finish the 10-ct sampler box. ",
                "Now, ginger isn't my favorite tea flavor, but having never tried explicitly ginger-flavored green tea yet, I figured this would be worthwhile, especially on sale. I liked it more than I thought I would. Dry-bag aroma was sharp, crisp, a distinctly peppery ginger that reminded me of a really good 'ginger beer' soda. Interspersed with tea leaves, a lot of obvious, irregularly shaped ginger nuggets or granules are evident in the bag, each around 1-2 mm in diameter. I can't recall such a potent ginger smell to a dry tea, to the extent it almost made me sneeze (and that doesn't happen easily). The liquid brewed up a slightly opaque, yellow hue that became a tan-yellow after a few minutes, tasting nowhere nearly as sharp and spicy as the dry smell. Instead, it was a sweet, smooth ginger ale flavor (instead of ginger beer), but with enough green tea to detect. The peppery sensation came back, just a bit, on the back of the tongue in each sip. Yes, the ginger dominated, but not so much that it would it taste simply like ground-up ginger root in water. The tea gives the mix some body and faintly vegetal character, but doesn't stand out much on its own merit. I hardly got any lemon except in aftertaste. The wet-bag aroma was sweetly and pleasantly gingery as well, with a little more bitterness than the flavor, and lacking the sneezy, pepper-like element. I suspect folks who enjoy ginger a lot would love this, if it's still widely available. I wonder if the fact I got it on retail discount, and it's not on Stash's website, indicates the tea has been discontinued. In that event, get some while you still can, if you still can. ",

Earl Grey green tea has a similar flavor and aroma to black Earl Grey tea, since the bergamot is a dominant and defining characteristic of the tea.

The bergamot flavoring is much lighter than in Bigelow's black tea Earl Grey, presumably to let the flavor of the green tea through, such as it is. The very light flavor of the base tea coupled with less bergamot makes for one of the most flavorless teas I've had, let alone of Earl Greys. It really just ends up tasting like the cheapest Chinese green tea bags that are ubiquitous in Asian grocery stores. If you like green tea, there's better green tea. If you like Earl Grey, there's better Earl Grey. Even Bigelow's own black tea Earl Grey, which I enjoy and drink quite often, is much better. ",

The trick is that is is flavoured with bergamot oil (usually found in Earl Grey Teas) and dried pieces of Seville oranges. The result is a truly amazing flavour that smooths (without masking) the traditional taste of green tea. I really recommend it for people who 'think' they do not like green teas!! I bought another couple of teas from Chateau Rouge that I will try and write a review on in due time.",

I'm not generally a fan of black teas, but bergamot is a nice flavor, so with the right green tea and done well, I bet that it would be lovely. Here, it was a bit too easy to overbrew the tea. The directions advise 2-4 minutes, but that's far too long. Leaving the bag in for more than a minute results in a somewhat bitter cup--which surprised me. A longer brew produced an even more bitter cup. My favorite brewing was the third time precisely because I didn't let it brew very long. If you like bergamot, this is a variation on Earl Grey that's worth trying. Just make sure that you keep the brew time short, not only with the first cup but also with later brewings. It diffuses quite quickly, so that shouldn't result in a weak cup.",

                "Back to traveling with motel stays again this year, and back to finding their teas I haven't rated yet! As always, I'll bring an extra bag home to try in my well water for consistency in rating, so that bad local water doesn't affect a tea's rating unduly. The concept behind 'Green Tea with Lemon' left me with a sense of pity, as it indicates a quantity of this tea's customers that approximates its non-food-service sales, who can't be bothered with adding their own (and fresher, and better) lemon to tea. This one's not bad, just somewhat pointless, and not outstanding either. A fairly plain green tea is soaked in a bit of lemon flavoring and presented in bagged form, with a moderate dry-bag and in-cup aroma. The lemon flavor is somewhat flat, but at least not sour, and stands out more in aftertaste than taste. Motels certainly could (and do!) offer worse to their departing morning customers, but I wouldn't proactively procure this tea for home use. "

Review #251  Cup at work, made from a mixture of green tea leaves, marigold blossoms, pieces of mango, and passion fruit granulate, all sprinkled with flavour. Pours clear mango yellow (against white china) with no sediment. Clear, intense aroma of mango, with touches of green tea leaves and hints of passion fruit. Mildly bitter flavour of green tea leaves, with intense mango notes. Somewhat astringent palate with leafy aftertaste, smooth, fruity notes, and citric touches. Fair price ((euros)5.40 per 100 g) A very nice one. I expected it to be sweeter, but then it's not a problem that it isn't. The brewing time, as stated on the label, is just 1.5 minutes, but I gave it a minute more to get more flavour. 9 4 4 85 12 g / l; 80 C; 2.5 min. Review #206  One-litre pot at home, made from a mixture of green tea leaves and lemon peel, sprinkled with flavour. Pours clear straw (against white china) with no sediment. Clear aroma of lemon, with notes of green tea leaves. Mildly bitter flavour of green tea, with clear notes of lemon and lime. Moderately astringent palate with citric and leafy aftertaste. A nice one. Quite dry and refreshing. Fair price ((euros)5.50 per 100 g). 7 4 4 70 12 g / l; 70 C; 2 min. Review #204  Half-litre pot at the company's tea lounge in Hamburg, made of a mixture of Sencha leaves and pieces of apple, rhubarb and raspberries, all sprinkled with flavouring. Pours slightly hazy light straw (against white china) with no sediment. Clear aroma of berries and rhubarb, with touches of Sencha. Delicate flavour of green tea with clear fruity notes, mostly those of berries, but the rhubarb and the apple can be clearly detected as well. Mildly astringent palate with an aftertaste of Sencha and apple. Decent and not very expensive if enjoyed at home ((euros)5.80 per 100 g; the pot in the lounge costs (euros)6.90, but then, well, the lounge is cute). 7 4 3 74 12 g / l; 90 C; 1.5 min. Review #193  Back to traveling with motel stays again this year, and back to finding their teas I haven't rated yet! As always, I'll bring an extra bag home to try in my well water for consistency in rating, so that bad local water doesn't affect a tea's rating unduly. The concept behind 'Green Tea with Lemon' left me with a sense of pity, as it indicates a quantity of this tea's customers that approximates its non-food-service sales, who can't be bothered with adding their own (and fresher, and better) lemon to tea. This one's not bad, just somewhat pointless, and not outstanding either. A fairly plain green tea is soaked in a bit of lemon flavoring and presented in bagged form, with a moderate dry-bag and in-cup aroma. The lemon flavor is somewhat flat, but at least not sour, and stands out more in aftertaste than taste. Motels certainly could (and do!) offer worse to their departing morning customers, but I wouldn't proactively procure this tea for home use. "

            "about": "Genmaicha or genmai cha, often called brown rice tea, is a Japanese tea made by mixing green tea, usually bancha or sencha, with toasted rice. The rice and corn impart a toasty and nutty quality to the aroma. When the rice is toasted, sometimes grains of rice pop, much like popcorn. In some genmaicha, only intact grains of rice are included; other blends include these popped grains. Genmaicha is also frequently blended with matcha, a powdered green tea that is normally brewed differently from most loose tea. The resulting blend is called Matcha-iri genmaicha, and is brewed like regular green tea, although the matcha imparts a unique quality to the resulting cup. Genmaicha tends to be lower in caffeine, especially when bancha is used as the base tea, but its caffeine content varies widely; it can be higher when made using sencha, or when matcha as added, and because it has a mild flavor, it can also be brewed fairly strongly. Genmaicha has recently achieved great popularity and is produced and widely available in many countries.",

                "My experience with genmaicha is very limited, and it's not my favorite tea type, so take this for what it's worth in that context. If the dry smell alone were the basis for evaluating a tea, I would have launched this stuff into the compost heap, untasted, with prejudice. Maybe I'm just not well-adapted to genmaicha teas. Still, the dry-bag smelled nothing like any sort of tea I've had, but instead, old rice cakes left out in the sun too long, with a hint of burned popcorn. The tea (sencha) was hard to detect at that stage, though plenty of chopped green tea leaves could be seen in the bag, mixed with little nuggets of toasted rice around 1-3 mm in width. Fortunately the flavor was a lot better! Indeed, this was the rare tea that tasted much more pleasant than the dry aroma. The liquid brewed up a yellow-green color, with flavor very well-balanced between toasted (not burned) rice, popcorn, and a really nice sencha tea that takes well to artificial sweetener. Normally brewed, it was noticeably, but not unpleasantly, astringent, and decidedly vegetal (of course!). It tolerates oversteeping too, based on an accidental then deliberate experiment of up to 8 minutes, with slightly murkier and darker color, but seemingly no more astringency nor excess bitterness. The aftertaste does get a little weird: still astringent, surprisingly bitter, and a bit algal. The wet bag aroma loses all the burned or smoky character of the dry bag, but gains some musty or moldy aroma the dry bag didn't have. I have read that good genmaicha tea is expensive, but as of this writing, Murchie's Canadian price converts to around US$10 for a 50-bag box. I suspect that folks who do appreciate genmaicha a lot would enjoy this tea overall more than I have, but I'll finish the 10-ct sampler box. ",
                "Best tea ever!! At least for me, since I love grain based teas like barley and buckwheat.

The price is great as well! definitely recommend anyone trying it. ",
                "I really wasn't impressed with this. I was hopeful because the reviews I found elsewhere were good. But, this tea lacks taste and body. There's nothing to it. I even contacted Maeda-en because I thought there might be an issue with the product. It's not what I've come to expect from their brand. Their teas are usually very good. This was weak. It wasn't bad in taste. It just was really weak -- and that's after I used more tea per cup than normal (about 1/2tsp to 1tsp more per serving). I wouldn't recommend this unless they address the quality issue. It doesn't make sense to have to add more than 1Tbsp of tea just to get taste when making a cup of tea. That's saying that something is wrong. Update: I let Maeda-en know that I wasn't happy with their Gold Genmai-cha tea and they were so kind as to send me replacements for both bags I ordered along with a bag of a different variety of genmaicha that they produce. I tried one of the replacement bags and the flavor still was very weak. It was a slight improvement, so I added some points. I also wanted to note how impressed I was with the company. I think it says a lot that they did this because they didn't have to. I'll update when I try the other bag, which has a different expiration date. I've been trying 1 Tbsp (heaping) with 80(degrees)C water, 300ml, for 55s. That's the time I use for their gold sencha, though I use 2 tsp of tea for that and get a good taste. I should note that the very fact that I have to use more than 2 tsp for 300ml makes the tea seem weak to me. I will update if I get better results trying different brewing combinations and/or when I try the bag with the other expiration date. Even though I wouldn't recommend this particular tea at this point, I would recommend Maeda-en as a company given this experience. I felt like they really went above and beyond, and given a choice, that's the kind of company I want my money to go to.",
                "I really like this genmaicha. Aside from tea in Asian restaurants, this is the only genmaicha that I've ever tasted. The kind that I have (I'm not sure if they've changed the recipe or not) has sorghum in addition to rice. It has a great, nutty, roasted flavor. There isn't much caffeine to it. I'm amazed that this tea has kept so long because I got it quite a long time ago. I imagine it would be even better if fresher. But, I think it says a lot that it still tastes good after so much time. I've tried both 85(degrees)C and 80(degrees)C and I prefer 80(degrees)C, but it needs a bit more time. I use cups that are 100-110ml each and put a nearly full-sized, cup-shaped strainer in it. I used 2tsp of leaves -- heaping. I rinse it for a maximum of 5s and then brew for 20-35s and then make a second cup with the same leaves for 30-45s. I only ever brew the leaves twice. The 80(degrees)C setting results in a nuttier, more buttery brew. When I make it with 85(degrees)C water, I rinse for a maximum of 5s, brew for about 20s and then for about 30s. It has almost no butteriness and less nuttiness, but more astringency and bitterness. I make it both ways regularly. It really depends upon your taste. Feel free to experiment, if you're making it. So long as you don't go wild and brew it for 10x as long as I listed, genmaicha is a pretty flexible tea to brew. It's hard to go too wrong with it. So, it's great for beginners just learning how to brew loose leaves or for people trying to perfect their brewing skills and wanting something a little easier for a change. I've had types of tea that it's taken me 50-100g worth of tries (with 3-5g per serving) to get it to brew well. So, compared to that, this is a great place to start. It's also really inexpensive, so that's another plus. YamaMotoYama also makes sencha. It's a pretty good house sencha (nothing fancy, a restaurant-grade sencha). It's also inexpensive and pretty easy to brew, if you're looking for a leaf-only loose tea to learn with (this genmaicha has rice, sorghum, and green tea in it, so it's not only tea leaves).",
                "An enjoyable, but not super interesting tea that struck me as a little pricey. One of my favorite genmaichas yet. Thank you to Upton, for throwing this in as a free sample with my order! Dry leaf looks a dusty bright yellow color, much more yellowish than most Matcha. Aroma is very mild, mostly of the toasted rice. This tea was fun to watch brew: as I poured water over the leaf, it initially washed off the dusty green matcha, exposing the brown and white colors of the toasted rice...but as the tea steeped, this color disappeared again under the cloudiness. I brewed it in a coarse-mesh basket infuser so that I could be sure that the matcha got out into the cup. I was careful to use a low water temperature when brewing. The cup had a cloudy appearance, but much thinner than matcha. The aroma was mild and mostly of genmaicha, although it was noticeably more vegetal. Flavor is exceptionally clean, and there's a certain boldness and strength that is usually absent from most genmaicha (as well as the bancha that usually serves as its base.) Lightly bitter and savory, with a hint of sourness. The toasted rice aroma is mostly evident when holding the cup up to your nose before sipping: upon sipping it it becomes a bit more vegetal. Flavor and overall character of the cup is mild. I used a heaping teaspoon and it was still on the weak side. Very low astringency, but this made the tea come across as a bit watery or thin-bodied. Resteeped better than I had expected; I suppose this is where this tea stood out. The resteep brought out more of a savory flavor and the toasted rice aroma, but had less vegetal notes. Overall, an interesting experience to drink. Seems more caffeinated than typical genmaicha, especially in the first cup. I very much enjoyed this one, but I'm not sure the amount of enjoyment justifies the price. There are many good Japanese green teas in this price range, and I think I'd prefer drinking a high-end sencha to this one. And some genmaicha, I enjoy just as much as this for less than half the price (it can be just as smooth, fuller-bodied, and often less caffeinated.) One of the big selling points of genmaicha, to me, is how cheap it is, so this offering puzzles me a bit. If left to my own devices, I'd just buy the cheap stuff."

The brewed cup tends a little more towards the rose side of neutral, but I can still smell the base tea in there. It smells fresh and light and reminds me of springtime. Very clean tasting and super easy and enjoyable to drink. I experimented with brewing temperature. A hotter temperature seems to yield more bite or edge, and a stronger aroma to the base tea, but the cup is still pleasant and drinkable. I preferred brewing this way: it especially brought out some grassy notes in the base tea, and I found the bitterness pleasant. Resteeps very well. The second cup is just as strong and aromatically complex as the first: the flavor is bold and both the rose and green tea are still present in the aroma. I liked a 3 minute first steep followed by an 8 minute steep for the second cup. Price is also very reasonable.

This blend is sometimes referred to as king's tea, emperor tea, or emperor oolong tea, or similar names. Ginseng tends to have a strong, earthy aroma which is not normally considered pleasing on its own; it is rarely used as an ingredient solely for taste, instead being included primarily for health reasons. However, the smoothness and sweetness of high-grown, greener oolong teas can complement the flavor and aroma of ginseng, and the earthy characteristics of both oolong tea and ginseng blend fairly well, making this a fairly natural blend of ingredients that some people do drink primarily for its flavor. Sometimes other flavorings or ingredients are added to these blends; we list such blends in this category if the base tea as an oolong and ginseng is the primary other ingredient.",

                "Before discussing the tea, I want to mention a little about the branding and packaging. First, the 'Ten Fu's' font and graphics look like they're intentionally similar to Ten Ren's trademark logo, but Ten Fu's and Ten Ren are different companies. Second, cans of Ten Fu's tea include a Taiwan logo on the can, which many brands of Taiwanese oolong teas display, including Ten Ren's King's Tea, which this tea seems to be a clone of. As far as I know, however, this tea's origin is mainland China. While I really like this tea and drink quite a lot of it personally, shady marketing practices should always be considered a red flag. Caveat emptor. The dry tea is dark green, has a strong aroma and smells sweet, rich and lightly grassy. The tea smells wonderful while brewing. The tea's flavor isn't quite as rich as the aroma, but it's still flavorful and has a nice body to it. The taste starts out mildly astringent and lightly fruity, reminiscent of ripe plum skins. The ginseng becomes apparent in the finish as a slightly bittersweet flavor reminiscent of licorice. The ginseng flavor lasts a long time on the palate. If you savor the finish before the next sip, a cup of this tea will last you a while. I usually drink this tea Western style, brewing the first cup for four minutes. Even so, while subsequent steepings have much less ginseng flavor, the oolong is high enough quality to get one or two more brews from the same leaves. This tea is so similar tasting to the Ten Ren fourth grade King's Tea that I have a hard time telling which tea I have from a single cup. Tasting them side by side, the Ten Ren tea has a slightly richer flavor overall, probably indicating a slightly higher grade of the base oolong tea. Ten Fu's tea tastes slightly more strongly of ginseng, which may be a pro or con depending on how much you like ginseng. In any case, the differences between the two are subtle and Ten Fu's tea is a little more than half the price of Ten Ren's 103 King's Tea ($2.03/oz compared to $3.34/oz).",
                "Ten Ren's King's Tea has been my favorite for years. The base tea is high quality to begin with and the ginseng is subtle enough that the flavors blend well. It's difficult for me to tell where the tea flavor ends and the ginseng begins. On the tongue, the tea is lightly bitter with an initial grassy flavor that gives way to a creaminess often found in high mountain oolongs. The finish fades into the ginseng flavor, which hints at a licorice sweetness. The aroma is lightly fruity with notes of both underripe strawberries and seaweed. I've tasted the higher grades of this tea that Ten Ren sells and while each subsequent grade is definitely more aromatic than the previous one, I find that the fourth grade offers the best value.",
                "I found the aroma to be very green, like bamboo leaves and herbaceous like dill weed. There is also earthiness and the aroma of baked bread with a slight undertone of sweetness. The ginseng is an odd smelling herb, it gives a slight muskiness to the already herbaceous aroma. The taste is strange yet good, it is the strangeness of trying something completely new. I have had ginseng before but only in candy or in supplements, this is my first time tasting it in a tea. At first the taste is slightly floral like cherry blossoms followed by the vegetal taste of asparagus. There is a hint of fruity tartness, like a mix of tart cherries and lychees. As the tea cools it takes on the typical chestnut flavor I associate with Oolongs.",
                "It's been a long time since I tried a ginseng oolong, so I'm not the most experienced reviewer of this type of blend. Dry leaf shows a dusty appearance, and has a strong but muted aroma, suggestive of greener oolongs, but perhaps more woody and earthy. Upon brewing, the aroma is predominately of oolong and the ginseng influence is only subtle. A smooth, clear tea with an earthy, dusty, and surprisingly sweet aftertaste. This oolong is pretty easily recognizable from a pure oolong, but it's hard to tell exactly where the tea's aroma and flavor end and the ginseng begins. More astringent than I'd like, and I suspect some of the astringency is coming from the ginseng as oolongs with this nice an aroma are usually smoother. This was pretty inexpensive, but I still prefer other oolongs form TeaVivre, and I can't see myself wanting to drink this every day."

            "doc": "Ginseng oolong tea is oolong tea, often greener (less oxidized) high-mountain oolong tea, that has been blended with ginseng, an herb valued for its medicinal properties. This blend is sometimes referred to as king's tea, emperor tea, or emperor oolong tea, or similar names. Ginseng tends to have a strong, earthy aroma which is not normally considered pleasing on its own; it is rarely used as an ingredient solely for taste, instead being included primarily for health reasons. However, the smoothness and sweetness of high-grown, greener oolong teas can complement the flavor and aroma of ginseng, and the earthy characteristics of both oolong tea and ginseng blend fairly well, making this a fairly natural blend of ingredients that some people do drink primarily for its flavor. Sometimes other flavorings or ingredients are added to these blends; we list such blends in this category if the base tea as an oolong and ginseng is the primary other ingredient.Before discussing the tea, I want to mention a little about the branding and packaging. First, the 'Ten Fu's' font and graphics look like they're intentionally similar to Ten Ren's trademark logo, but Ten Fu's and Ten Ren are different companies. Second, cans of Ten Fu's tea include a Taiwan logo on the can, which many brands of Taiwanese oolong teas display, including Ten Ren's King's Tea, which this tea seems to be a clone of. As far as I know, however, this tea's origin is mainland China. While I really like this tea and drink quite a lot of it personally, shady marketing practices should always be considered a red flag. Caveat emptor. The dry tea is dark green, has a strong aroma and smells sweet, rich and lightly grassy. The tea smells wonderful while brewing. The tea's flavor isn't quite as rich as the aroma, but it's still flavorful and has a nice body to it. The taste starts out mildly astringent and lightly fruity, reminiscent of ripe plum skins. The ginseng becomes apparent in the finish as a slightly bittersweet flavor reminiscent of licorice. The ginseng flavor lasts a long time on the palate. If you savor the finish before the next sip, a cup of this tea will last you a while. I usually drink this tea Western style, brewing the first cup for four minutes. Even so, while subsequent steepings have much less ginseng flavor, the oolong is high enough quality to get one or two more brews from the same leaves.

Stronger-flavored fruits, such as lemon, are less often used to flavor white tea as the subtle flavor and aroma of white tea are easily overpowered by bold aromas and flavors. White tea can be flavored by fruit extracts, or it can be blended with whole pieces of dried fruit. Often, the type of tea used in fruit white teas is not specified. Typically, white teas such as shou mei or white peony are used, not necessarily because of their lower cost, but because other white teas can have very delicate aromas that are easily overpowered by any sort of flavoring.Prep: 175F, 5min, 2 heaping tsp, 16oz Aroma: This took a little bit of time to come to the forefront.

Jasmine tea is frequently made out of green tea, although it can be made of black tea, white tea, or pouchong (bao zhong) as well. Jasmine tea has a floral aroma that is sometimes described as perfume-like. Although it is usually associated with Chinese tea culture, jasmine tea is one of the most well-known of the traditional scented teas, and is popular and widely-available in Western countries as well, and is one of several teas commonly served in Chinese restaurants. An overwhelming majority of jasmine tea is produced in China, where it originated, with small amounts made in Taiwan. The largest producer is Fujian province, but some jasmine tea is made in at least 9 different provinces. Other countries, including India and Boliiva, have produced Jasmine tea but only in limited batches that are not regularly available. Tea connoisseurs and specialty tea companies make an important distinction between traditionally scented jasmine tea and modern 'shortcut' methods. Traditionally, jasmine tea is produced by placing jasmine blossoms together with the tea leaf in a closed area, shortly after the blossoms open. After most of the aroma has left the blossoms, these blossoms are removed, and new, fresh blossoms are added. The number of scentings differs greatly from tea to tea; because this process is time-consuming and labor intensive, it greatly adds to the cost of the tea. Some high grades of jasmine use as many as 7 or more scentings in their production. In contrast, some tea companies just add an oil or extract to the tea leaves. If this oil is naturally produced (or even organic), the resulting jasmine tea will be considered all natural (or organic) by western standards, but such teas have been produced by a shortcut, from the perspective of traditional processing methods. Rather than listing jasmine teas under the headings of flavored green, black, etc. teas, RateTea lists all jasmine teas under its own category or sub-categories because they tend to have much more in common with each other aroma-wise than they do with their base teas. Some studies have examined the health effects of jasmine tea or chemicals isolated from jasmine tea. However, most of these studies have focused on the catechins, antioxidants originating in the tea plant, and not the jasmine flowers. One study, however, examined the aroma of jasmine tea and found that it had a sedative effect. The odor of jasmine tea was compared to lavender, a scent known to also promote relaxation, and found to have a similar effect. The chemical, (R)-(-)-linalool, originating in the jasmine plant, was found to be responsible for some of these effects. [1] ",

                "One of my kids gave me this for Christmas, having bought it at an Asian food store for an unknown price, so I'm basing the value rating off the mostly reasonable online costs for a 120g tin. The packaging of this tea confused me a bit at first, as it was branded just like one of the same title on RateTea, but in a tin that looked a lot different. Fortunately the prior reviewer offers a great explanation of the discrepancy. For the record, I've added a photo of the opened, Sunflower 2060 'red tin' version of this tea I received, so folks can see either of them. The dry leaves are very dark green to nearly black, but become much more classically green during steeping, as they unfurl. This tea also has a lot of stems in it, and an occasional white petal piece, which I only can assume is jasmine that didn't get sifted out. Both indicate lackadaisical processing. Aromatically and flavor-wise, this is a pleasant but not outstanding jasmine tea, nothing very out of the ordinary in my experience for either bagged or loose. I'll finish the tin, but won't seek out more. The dry-leaf smell was a little grassy as well as 'jasminey'. The in-cup and wet-leaf smells offered slightly more of the base tea in a sweet, faintly musty form, reminiscent of moist old wood timbers in an abandoned house. [I've photographed a lot of abandoned houses, so it's a familiar aroma.] In the cups I've had so far, I brewed this tea three different ways: 1) boiling hot for 4-5 minutes as with black tea, 2) a couple minutes of cooling of boiled water, then 3 minutes as with most greens, and 3) accidentally cooled water left in a thermos for a few hours to 'somewhat hot' level, then soaking leaves for 8-9 minutes. I didn't notice a lot of difference between these disparate steeping tactics, but felt the jasmine was strongest with the long brew in slightly hot water, and could taste the base tea quite well with each method. All yielded about the same (high) level of astringency and moderate bitterness.",
                "This was a peculiar yet pleasant jasmine-tea experience, stem to stern. The jasmine scent in both the dry bag and steeped cup were stronger than the tea, and than it asserted in the flavor. Instead, the flavor overall is very well-balanced between jasmine and tea. That's good, because the green tea tastes like a very rich, robust, earthy, vegetal variety that expresses itself well in the presence of a strong floral element like jasmine. While drinking, I noticed that the floral and green-tea balance held until near the end of each sip, then the tea took over, then the jasmine reasserted itself in the aftertaste. That was strange, but rather pleasant, for the flavors to balance, then alternate in waves that way. In a mirror-image reversal of the dry-bag experience, the wet-bag aroma was very tea-dominant, but with jasmine noticeable. Overall, especially given the favorable exchange rates, this is a great value for a quality bagged jasmine tea."

I found the aroma somewhat cloying. Thankfully, the brewed cup was more pleasant. Very mild flavor, sweet and with very little bitterness or sourness, and little astringency.

Because silver needle naturally has a mild flavor and a floral scent, this scented tea has a mild flavor and an intense floral fragrance. In contrast to green teas, where the base tea's character is more distinctly evident, the floral qualities of the base tea often tend to blend with the scenting in this style of jasmine tea. Like the base tea, this style of tea can be deceptively strongly caffeinated, relative to its smooth, mild flavor. Although white teas are widely perceived as being low in caffeine, this is a myth. Silver needle tea, consisting exclusively of tips, is highest in caffeine among white teas.strong jasmine scent...4 minute steep...nothing special about this tea...mediocre taste and when the high cost is involved it isn't worth it in my opinion ...strong jasmine taste but that's all I was really impressed with the scent and flavor of this tea, this is probably one of the best jasmine teas I've had. Good job, Wegmans!  This one was surprisingly different from the pure, unscented silver needles from Wegmans. I liked it much more. Compared to other jasmine silver needles I tried in the past but did not review, this one was much more aromatic. The dry leaf smells very strongly like wintergreen, almost suggestive of bubblegum. I found the aroma somewhat cloying. Thankfully, the brewed cup was more pleasant. Very mild flavor, sweet and with very little bitterness or sourness, and little astringency.

Roasted barley tea is popular in Japan, where it is called mugicha, and in Korea, where it is called boricha. The word 'tisane', now a general word for herbal tea, originated from the French word ptisana for barley water.[1] Barley tea can be drunk both hot and iced. In Japan, it is a popular summer drink, commonly served iced. The Korean variant is often served hot. Japanese brands are widely available in tea bags designed for cold-brewing. The blog Just Hungry offers a few tips on preparation on their post Mugicha (barley tea) is the flavor of summer in Japan. A barley-based beverage, called Caff\u00e8 d'orzo, is also popular in Italy; that drink is different in style and preparation from the Japanese and Korean barley teas, more similar to how hot chocolate or espresso is prepared than to most tea. This drink is often called barley coffee. Rather than being steeped for flavor and then removed, the barley is added directly to hot water to make a thicker drink; milk is usually added. Orzo is Italian for barley, not to be confused with the pasta of the same name, which is named because it resembles cooked barley kernels. In addition to this beverage, Italian varieties of barley are sometimes used to make barley teas that are prepared more like traditional Japanese and Korean types, by steeping the barley in hot water like conventional teas. To complicate things further, people in Latin American countries drink beverages called caf\u00e9 de cebada, which is literally translated 'coffee of barley', which are prepared more like the barley teas of Japan and Korea. Mugicha or boricha can be made at home from whole barley kernels, by toasting them in a pan and then steeping the roasted kernels in or storing them for later steeping. Whole barley kernels are available at most supermarkets and bulk food stores. The blog La Fuji Mama offers instructions on Making your own mugicha by roasting your own barley. Commercial preparations often involve crushing the barley; crushing has been shown to increase the intensity of the flavor and aroma.[2] Because it is made of whole grain kernels, barley tea does not stay fresh as long as most dried herbal teas once it has been opened. It can be frozen for short periods of time but is generally best to buy only in as small a packet as you can use up quickly. Barley tea contains more calories than is typical for an herbal tea, but the amount is still small relative to most caloric drinks like milk or juice. Barley tea has been shown to contain a number of compounds with potent antioxidant activity.[3] Barley contains gluten, so it needs to be avoided by people sensitive to gluten. Some preliminary work has shown that barley coffee helps to prevent bacteria from adhering to surfaces, which suggests that it may be useful for promoting oral health and preventing tooth decay.[4] It also has been shown to promote blood fluidity.[5] ",

When buying teas, check the ingredient list if you are unsure whether a given product is pure chamomile or a blend containing other herbs. This category of chamomile blend is for herbal blends that have chamomile as the primary ingredient, are named 'chamomile', or have chamomile as the dominant note in the aroma, but also contains other herbs or ingredients. It is common for companies to sell such blends under the name of 'chamomile' or 'chamomile tea'. We have a separate category for pure chamomile teas, including no other ingredients. Many herbal teas contain chamomile as a minor ingredient among many different herbs; these we list in the general herbal tea category. Chamomile blends are common and diverse. Ingredients and flavors commonly blended with chamomile include mints (both spearmint and peppermint), lemon or other citrus, lemon-scented herbs such as lemongrass or lemon verbena, various other fruits, or other flowers. Pure chamomile tea often has a fruity aroma and a muted flavor with a bitter aftertaste. The ingredients blended with the chamomile are often chosen both to mitigate the bitterness in the finish, to give the blend a little more bite up-front, and to blend well with the aromas, complementing or synergizing with the fruity qualities. Many chamomile blends are specifically marketed for the supposed relaxing or sleep-inducing properties of chamomile. Blends with chamomile as the dominant ingredient likely have similar effects to the pure herb; commonly, other herbs with similar effects are also blended. We review these properties as pertaining to pure chamomile on our page on chamomile tea and sleep, and you can find information about other relaxing herbs in our article on herbs and herbal teas for anxiety.",

Pours clear amber (against white china) with negligible sediment. Clear aroma of chamomile, with fruity notes of apples and rose hip, and touches of cinnamon. Herbal flavour of chamomile with mild touches of apples and orange peel and hints of cocoa. Mild palate with herbal and spicy aftertaste and acidic hints.

            "doc": "A lot of herbal blends marketed as 'chamomile' also contain numerous other ingredients. When buying teas, check the ingredient list if you are unsure whether a given product is pure chamomile or a blend containing other herbs. This category of chamomile blend is for herbal blends that have chamomile as the primary ingredient, are named 'chamomile', or have chamomile as the dominant note in the aroma, but also contains other herbs or ingredients. It is common for companies to sell such blends under the name of 'chamomile' or 'chamomile tea'. We have a separate category for pure chamomile teas, including no other ingredients. Many herbal teas contain chamomile as a minor ingredient among many different herbs; these we list in the general herbal tea category. Chamomile blends are common and diverse. Ingredients and flavors commonly blended with chamomile include mints (both spearmint and peppermint), lemon or other citrus, lemon-scented herbs such as lemongrass or lemon verbena, various other fruits, or other flowers. Pure chamomile tea often has a fruity aroma and a muted flavor with a bitter aftertaste. The ingredients blended with the chamomile are often chosen both to mitigate the bitterness in the finish, to give the blend a little more bite up-front, and to blend well with the aromas, complementing or synergizing with the fruity qualities. Many chamomile blends are specifically marketed for the supposed relaxing or sleep-inducing properties of chamomile. Blends with chamomile as the dominant ingredient likely have similar effects to the pure herb; commonly, other herbs with similar effects are also blended. We review these properties as pertaining to pure chamomile on our page on chamomile tea and sleep, and you can find information about other relaxing herbs in our article on herbs and herbal teas for anxiety.Cup at home, made from a sachet included in the tea company's Advent Tea Calendar (2020) and containing a mixture of chamomile flowers, pieces of cinnamon, apple, and rose hip, as well as cocoa and orange peel - all organic and sprinkled with natural flavourings. Pours clear amber (against white china) with negligible sediment. Clear aroma of chamomile, with fruity notes of apples and rose hip, and touches of cinnamon. Herbal flavour of chamomile with mild touches of apples and orange peel and hints of cocoa. Mild palate with herbal and spicy aftertaste and acidic hints. Well, I do like chamomile blends but this one is rather tame. I had expected more pronounced fruity notes and perhaps an extra touch of spice. Drinkable, though, and definitely enjoyable, too. Not an unreasonable price, given the context (ca. 5 DKK per 1 sachet in the collection). Thank you, Anni, for this gem! 7 3 3 65 1 sachet / 250 ml; 100 C; 5 min. Review #161  all the flavors put together makes my entire night. this is the best chamomile blend i have ever tried and even people who don't usually like tea like it and that makes me so happy. Here is a nice organic tisane, made predominantly with chamomile and bolstered with some fruits, rose hips, and hibiscus. So it tastes mostly of chamomile, but with a steely, acidic undertone. The aroma is fairly strong and floral. The price is a little high, but I guess that is due to the organic ingredients. This is a nice before-bed cup. I continue to enjoy Serendipitea's tisanes.

This was a single teabag thrown in as a free sample from the Philadelphia Coffee and Tea Festival; I'm glad I finally tried it.

This is full bodied, very dark in color, like coffee, far darker than any tea. Has a richness that I usually only encounter in coffee, there's even the sour flavor--still present enough to taste authentic, but a little less acidic than typical coffee. The aroma is also very coffee-like. There's perhaps a bit less of the in-your-face roast as it's brewing, but the roasty aroma is there and pleasant, and I love the nutty qualities--they smell fully natural, rich and earthy rather than the fleeting flavorings that plague some flavored coffees or teas. The main difference that jumps out at me as being different from coffee is that there is little up-front bitterness or kick, instead a muted bitterness that comes later. The aftertaste is actually very similar to coffee--even leaving an astringency and sourness on my palate (something I'm not crazy about with coffee). I tend to like Hazelnut-flavored coffees, and I think I like this better than any example of such. The fact that it is completely caffeine-free, yet more flavorful than any decaf I've ever tried, is a huge plus. I am actually drinking it, and writing this review, in the evening.

It's pretty exceptional. It's a little pricey per-cup, but decent coffee tends to be slightly pricier per-cup than tea. The only note of caution...I know some people don't like carob, and this does contain carob. It doesn't exactly dominate, but when I was looking for it in the aroma, I could sense it. So people who strongly object to carob will probably notice it. I rather like carob, and I thought it blended into the background and I mainly got a more general roasted aroma.

            "about": "Flavored rooibos is rooibos (South African 'red tea'), which has been flavored or blended with herbs, spices, fruit, or other flavoring, much in the same way black, green, and white teas can be flavored or blended. Because rooibos is naturally caffeine-free, flavored rooibos is a caffeine-free herbal tea. Blends of rooibos with other ingredients can be classified either here or in the more generic herbal tea category. On RateTea we classify blends as flavored rooibos if they contain 'rooibos' in the name, or if rooibos is the primary ingredient. Other blends with rooibos as one ingredient among many, we put in the broader herbal tea category. Any blends of rooibos with tea or other caffeinated ingredients such as yerba mate, we include in the miscellaneous blend category. Rooibos has an aroma and flavor profile somewhat similar to black tea, and is often seen as a caffeine-free tea substitute. Because of this, many of the popular flavorings or blending ingredients used with black teas are also used with rooibos. Two of the most common and popular blends include rooibos Earl Grey, using oil from the bergamot orange, or rooibos chai (or more accurately, spiced rooibos), a spiced blend imitating masala chai. However, rooibos is distinct from black tea: it is often described as mellower or smoother in flavor (less bitter, astringent, or tannic) and sometimes more fruity. Its flavor often combines well with berries such a strawberry or raspberry, or other fruits such as citrus, pear, or apple. Vanilla and coconut are also common and popular pairings.",

                "This blend of rooibos, orange peels, hibiscus, and cloves (the visually obvious ingredients...I think there's some cinnamon and ginger in this too) wasted no time rocketing to the top of my flavored-rooibos list, and very nearly the top of all herbals for me. The website says the tea is modeled after pomander oranges, which makes sense with the cloves so highly involved, but the flavor is more complex than that. Part of a holiday-tea variety box, I could detect this tea's dry aroma outside the wrapping of the box, then outside the box, then outside the sealed, Ziploc-style sack in which it is packaged. That's with three other teas in the box too. Upon opening the sack, an intense fruit/spice aroma wafted across the combined kitchen and living room, catching the attention of my wife while she was watching a favorite TV show. The scent? An eruptive, alluringly sweet fusion of Juicy Fruit gum and chai spice is the closest analog I can wield. It thoroughly overpowers the rooibos in dry form, but is so pleasant and intense that to not smell the rooibos was no disappointment. Worry not, rooibos fans-you can detect the rooibos in the flavor directly. Non-rooibos fans: the rooibos (which seems to be of good quality) is tamed by the fruit and spice enough that it serves mainly as a ballast or vector, more than a freestanding component. Folks who don't like rooibos therefore might enjoy this brew, regardless. The flavor overall is nowhere nearly as strong as the dry scent, but still quite pleasurable for anyone who likes a fruity herbal, with strong orange, a faint twinge of sourness from hibiscus, and rooibos' earthiness (but without the broom-straw effect of plain rooibos). The bonus: a well-developed cloves kick with a hint of cinnamon that you don't get from typical fruit herbals such as Celestial's 'Zinger' line. The aftertaste is similar, and takes a very long time to fade off. When I breathe in through my mouth after a few sips, there's a distinct cooling effect too, with a background flavor reminiscent of wintergreen. In my experience with herbal teas, it's extraordinary for so many flavors to swirl forth at different levels, and they're all good. Whomever conceived and blended this one at Murchie's has a solid keeper. This should be more than just a seasonal tea.",

It's also labeled as naturally flavored. Therefore, even though I ordinarily wouldn't buy a 40-pack of a new tea taste-untested, I figured a gamble on this offering from Whole Foods. It worked...this is one of my favorite flavored rooibos teas. The dry-bag scent is quite well-balanced between rooibos and orange, with a hint of vanilla, and representatively foretells the actual flavor. Somehow, the in-cup aroma and wet-bag scent lose much of the orange and are heavily rooibos-weighted, but the orange cream blend comes back in the flavor and aftertaste. None of the flavors are weak at all, after 3-5 minutes of brewing that turns the liquid a good, dark bromine-red color characteristic of quality rooibos. All in all, this was a remarkably flavorful, smooth, rich drink, rather uncharacteristic of store-brand rooibos teas in my somewhat-limited experience with them. At a cost of only about 11(cents)-12(cents) per bag retail as of this writing, the value in the 40-pack is excellent if you like fruity rooibos teas.

                "The first thing I notice about this tea is how very strongly it smells like cinnamon, I really like that smell. The dominating taste is definitely the cinnamon and also the cardamom. This is a very intense herbal tea and I wouldn't drink it for relaxation, but I would definitely drink it other times like in the morning. Although it's strong, I really do enjoy it because it is not bitter or astringent! I normally am not crazy about chai teas but this one is really good. This is a very enjoyable tea and I would definitely drink this again! ",
                "The dry-bag* and in-cup scents were robust and screamed 'chai', which is great since I enjoy such tea. Cinnamon and cardamom stood obvious, cloves and black pepper being apparent with some concentration, the other ingredients a good deal less so. Even though ginger is the second ingredient (behind rooibos), I only could taste it with great effort...or was that an illusion of the power of suggestion? Despite the presence of classic chai ingredients: 1) I still could taste the rooibos, specifically the 'broom straw' character that rooibos offers to me, to which I've grown accustomed by now, and 2) it's at least as much a 'smooth and sweet' flavor as spicy. Still, it's well-balanced in taste, not weak at all but also not slap-your-face strong either. This would be appropriate to treat as a 'decaf chai', or a mellow chai to drink if you want to avoid caffeine and/or tannins. For that purpose, it's very good-a nice hot cup to quaff on a cool, rainy evening a couple hours before bedtime. * For the first time with any tea, pre-consumptive dry-bag sniffing tickled my nostrils to the point of sneezing. It contains black pepper as the final listed ingredient; but that alone almost never has triggered the reflex. Something about the combination of that, cinnamon and ginger probably conspired to prompt the sudden respiratory evacuation. Even now, sniffing the old, empty packet nearly does so! As such, this may be a good tea to whiff if you need to sneeze but can't, for whatever reason, and regardless of any attributes of the beverage itself. Also, if you like to squeeze tea bags out to capture the embedded liquid and flavors (waste not, want not), be advised: the bag did rupture easier than most."

Review #219  Half-litre pot at home, made from fine rooibos leaves. Pours clear orangeish amber with no sediment. Clear aroma of rooibos, with touches of fruit and mild hints of chili. Mild but clear flavour of rooibos, with fruity touches and clear but not aggresive notes of chili. Creamy palate with an aftertaste of chili and mild touches of fruit. Very well balanced and quite simple. Fair price (38 DKK per 100 g). Reasonable but not any exceptional experience. 7 3 4 70 13 g / l; 100 C; 6 min. Review #39 The first thing I notice about this tea is how very strongly it smells like cinnamon, I really like that smell. The dominating taste is definitely the cinnamon and also the cardamom. This is a very intense herbal tea and I wouldn't drink it for relaxation, but I would definitely drink it other times like in the morning. Although it's strong, I really do enjoy it because it is not bitter or astringent! I normally am not crazy about chai teas but this one is really good. This is a very enjoyable tea and I would definitely drink this again!  The dry-bag* and in-cup scents were robust and screamed 'chai', which is great since I enjoy such tea. Cinnamon and cardamom stood obvious, cloves and black pepper being apparent with some concentration, the other ingredients a good deal less so. Even though ginger is the second ingredient (behind rooibos), I only could taste it with great effort...or was that an illusion of the power of suggestion? Despite the presence of classic chai ingredients: 1) I still could taste the rooibos, specifically the 'broom straw' character that rooibos offers to me, to which I've grown accustomed by now, and 2) it's at least as much a 'smooth and sweet' flavor as spicy. Still, it's well-balanced in taste, not weak at all but also not slap-your-face strong either. This would be appropriate to treat as a 'decaf chai', or a mellow chai to drink if you want to avoid caffeine and/or tannins. For that purpose, it's very good-a nice hot cup to quaff on a cool, rainy evening a couple hours before bedtime. * For the first time with any tea, pre-consumptive dry-bag sniffing tickled my nostrils to the point of sneezing. It contains black pepper as the final listed ingredient; but that alone almost never has triggered the reflex. Something about the combination of that, cinnamon and ginger probably conspired to prompt the sudden respiratory evacuation. Even now, sniffing the old, empty packet nearly does so! As such, this may be a good tea to whiff if you need to sneeze but can't, for whatever reason, and regardless of any attributes of the beverage itself. Also, if you like to squeeze tea bags out to capture the embedded liquid and flavors (waste not, want not), be advised: the bag did rupture easier than most."

                "With this, I will have reviewed a tea named Mango Maui (Hawaiian Islands Tea Company) and Maui Mango (Tiesta). They're radically different, however. The former is a very good, flavored black tea, while this one is mostly dried fruit by volume (pineapple, orange slices, mango, and strawberry) with flowers sprinkled in (safflower, hibiscus, marigold). The dry-bag aroma is pleasant, both floral and fruity, but a little disjointed, with seemingly incompatible scents of marigold and pineapple-citrus competing more than blending. That cleans up in-cup, with both a smell and flavor that suggest a somewhat bitter, astringent, yet tangy fruit blend. I can detect the mango, but it definitely is as pineapple- and orange-dominant as the order of the ingredients list suggests. I guess 'Maui Pineapple-Orange' wouldn't satisfy the marketing department's alliterative catchiness demands, however. I loaded this with the usual dose of sweetener, and because of the components (and apparently, a bit of added sugar) the tea came out very sweet, which doesn't bother me. However, the finish and especially aftertaste got rather syrupy and sticky in character, which can be a turn-off to some. The fruit pieces are big enough to be worth eating after steeping, especially if you can separate them from the flower shards. Also, even when using a very fine-meshed strainer, a thin layer of fine, fibrous debris made it through to the liquid itself, and floated on top. That doesn't affect the drinking experience, but...for full disclosure, now you know. It also was rather expensive for a 2-oz. bag, but that could be because of where I got it (Whole Foods).

            "about": "Hibiscus tea, also called roselle tea, is an herbal tea made from hibiscus flowers. This drink is often consumed iced, and is often sweetened. It has a sour flavor and bears some resemblance to fruit juices. Although the dried tea looks like it is made from petals, it is actually made from the sepals (calyces), the small structures at the base of the flower. Many species of hibiscus are grown ornamentally, but the species Hibiscus sabdariffa (also known as roselle) is the most common one used in herbal teas. Chinese hibiscus, or Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, is also sometimes used to produce herbal teas, but this article focuses on the sabdariffa species. The roselle species can be grown commercially, as a perennial, in hot tropical areas, or as an annual in colder climates. Hibiscus tea is produced only from certain cultivars or varieties of Hibiscus sabdariffa; other cultivars of this plant are used to produce fiber, or for ornamental purposes such as landscaping and gardening. Hibiscus is also one of the most common ingredients in herbal blends; it even occurs as the main ingredient in many herbal blends widely available in supermarkets in the U.S. Hibiscus is rather acidic, and its most common use in blends is to impart a sour taste and dark red or purple color, although it also imparts aroma as well. Hibiscus tea is widely consumed as a drink on its own from Southeast Asia to Africa and the Caribbean; each of these regions puts their own unique twist on how the drink is prepared. In Latin America, the drink is known as agua de flor de Jamaica, sometimes shortened to agua de Jamaica, rosa de Jamaica, or just Jamaica. In Panama, hibiscus tea is called saril. In North Africa, especially Egypt, the drink is called karkad\u00e9 which just means hibiscus in Arabic; this region has a long history of the use of this drink. In some regions, hibiscus is also blended with black tea. Hibiscus tea has traditionally been used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), lower fever, and treat liver disorders. Hibiscus is also rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants. A human study has validated that hibiscus tea, in an amount easily incorporated into the diet, is effective at lowering blood pressure in people suffering from hypertension[1]. The extract of the hibiscus sabdariffa plant has been studied more extensively and compared to various drugs used to lower blood pressure: it was found in a 2004 study to be roughly comparable in effect and tolerability to captopril[2], and a 2007 study found it to be less effective than lisinopril, but it showed 100(percent) tolerability (absence of intense side effects) in this study[3]. It is likely that hibiscus acts to lower blood pressure through being an ACE inhibitor.[3] There is evidence both from studies on rats and rabbits, and more recently, human studies, that hibiscus sabdariffa can lower cholesterol levels[4]. Studies in mice and rats have also validated that hibiscus has a fever-lowering (antipyretic) effect, and the evidence suggests that the mechanism by which it acts is different from that of aspirin.[5] A study in mice found that hibiscus sabdariffa can prevent liver damage caused by acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol and a number of other pain-killers, which is known to cause liver damage in high enough doses.[6] ",

Though many (or even most) blended herbal teas contain hibiscus, few brands offer unblended hibiscus teabags and the ones that do tend to be overpriced. Hibiscus is tart and fruity, almost like unsweetened Kool-Aid. If it's stale, the fruitiness fades, leaving just sour. The Badia was clearly fresh when packed in the foil pouches and is pleasantly flavored. While not as cheap as bulk hibiscus petals (often well under a dollar an ounce), $2.49 for 20 Badia teabags is comparable in price to other grocery store herbal teas. ",

Online you can find recipes to make a Jamaican version of this tea adding ginger and other herbs but a teabag alone with no additions (I add sugar while it is hot) makes a wonderful tea. Cold, iced sorrel tea (hibiscus tea) is fantastic! My only problem with it is that I get so addicted to it I drink too much and it upsets my stomach due to too much citrus which I don't tolerate well. You can also make a Jamaican Punch using this tea and adding rum (and other herbs as well). ",

It is likely that hibiscus acts to lower blood pressure through being an ACE inhibitor.[3] There is evidence both from studies on rats and rabbits, and more recently, human studies, that hibiscus sabdariffa can lower cholesterol levels[4]. Studies in mice and rats have also validated that hibiscus has a fever-lowering (antipyretic) effect, and the evidence suggests that the mechanism by which it acts is different from that of aspirin.[5] A study in mice found that hibiscus sabdariffa can prevent liver damage caused by acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol and a number of other pain-killers, which is known to cause liver damage in high enough doses.[6] Interesting option for a quick cold brewed tea. Aroma: faint, very faint peach notes and almost nothing else. I almost want to try this with sparkling water to see if it pops more. Flavor: very mild peach ring notes. Not too sweet. Thin body. Value: fairly expensive shelf tea. Wouldn't recommend. Good quality, straightforward hibiscus flower tea. Bulk hibiscus flowers are cheap, but quality can be hit or miss. Though many (or even most) blended herbal teas contain hibiscus, few brands offer unblended hibiscus teabags and the ones that do tend to be overpriced. Hibiscus is tart and fruity, almost like unsweetened Kool-Aid. If it's stale, the fruitiness fades, leaving just sour. The Badia was clearly fresh when packed in the foil pouches and is pleasantly flavored. While not as cheap as bulk hibiscus petals (often well under a dollar an ounce), $2.49 for 20 Badia teabags is comparable in price to other grocery store herbal teas.  I am a lifelong drinker of black iced tea (Luzianne)). When I need to cut back my caffeine intake later in the day so I am not kept awake, I switch to Luzianne's new Hibiscus Iced Tea. When prepared according to directions, it produces a deep red, rich tasting tea that never clouds up even when refrigerated or kept overnight. It does not have that weak herbal tea taste either. I don't know how this famous tea company achieved this superior product but I am an avid fan. I plan to serve this lovely hibiscus tea to everyone at my brother's birthday party next week. A wonderful new discovery. Delightful tea made from the dried calyx of a hibiscus-type plant. The taste is floral and citrus and the color is ruby red. Red Zinger tea is the name given by Celestial Seasonings but Badia's is much nicer in my opinion. Online you can find recipes to make a Jamaican version of this tea adding ginger and other herbs but a teabag alone with no additions (I add sugar while it is hot) makes a wonderful tea. Cold, iced sorrel tea (hibiscus tea) is fantastic! My only problem with it is that I get so addicted to it I drink too much and it upsets my stomach due to too much citrus which I don't tolerate well. You can also make a Jamaican Punch using this tea and adding rum (and other herbs as well).  Yummy! It's a beautiful red color, the aroma is nice, and the flavor isn't too astringent for being mostly hibiscus - it's summery and tropical and fresh. I brewed the first cup for a little less than three minutes, and got a decent second cup out of it. "

            "about": "Honeybush, sometimes called honeybush tea is a type of herbal tea produced in South Africa. Honeybush tea is made out of a number of different species in the Cyclopia genus, which are all legumes, all endemic to a small region in the south of South Africa. Some types of honeybush are gathered in the wild, whereas others are cultivated. Species used in herbal tea include C. intermedia, C. genistoides, C. maculata, C. sessiflora, and C. subternata. Honeybush is similar to (and often confused with) rooibos, another herbal tea from an overlapping region of South Africa, also made from a legume. Like rooibos, honeybush is traditionally produced through an oxidation process much like black tea, but green honeybush, pictured on the left, has recently started being produced, using processes similar to those used to produce green tea and green rooibos. Oxidized honeybush is traditionally processed through bruising of the leaves followed by sun-drying, but some industrial processes now use heated tanks and air-drying. Honeybush harvesting has increased greatly in recent years, from 27 metric tons in 1997 to 180 metric tons in 2013. The South African Broadcasting Corp issued a warning that one species, Cyclopia intermedia, is under threat of extinction. One major threat is unsustainable wild harvesting, but the plants are also threatened by invasive species, including Australia Wattles (Acacia sp.), and Monterey pine (Pinus radiata), which is ironically threatened in its native habitat.[1] Research on honeybush is in its early stages, with no human studies and only a small amount of animal studies.[2] Early animal research suggests honeybush possesses potent antioxidant, immune-modulating and cancer-preventing activity.[2] The use of honeybush as an herbal tea has also been considered safe, with no adverse effects reported.[2] One species of honeybush, Cyclopia genistoides, has been shown to have phytoestrogenic properties, meaning that it contains chemicals that have estrogen-like effects on the body.[3] There is evidence that these properties are attributable to chemicals found only in the genistoides species and not other species of honeybush.[3] Phytoestrogens, including the ones present in honeybush and a variety of other plants, have been suggested as a way to protect post-menopausal women from a broad range of problems, including breast cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, menopausal symptoms, and brain deterioration.[4] ",

Lemon balm shares certain components of its essential oil with lemongrass, lemon verbena, and lemon myrtle, but its aroma is usually described as gentler and less intense than these herbs. Of these herbs, it is most closely related to lemon verbena, and not closely related to the others. Although easy to grow and widely available as plants in nursery centers, it is not as widely available as a dried herb, and is an uncommon ingredient in herbal blends. Lemon balm can be brewed as a fresh herbal tea, by steeping fresh leaves directly in boiling water, or it can be dried, and the dry leaves steeped. Lemon balm grows as a perennial, and is very easy to cultivate in moist temperate climates. It grows aggressively and can sometimes become a pest in gardens; it often naturalizes and grows wild in gardens and even in cities. It can be grown easily from seed or from cutting, and tends to grow in clumps. Lemon balm is commonly used as a relaxing herb, to reduce anxiety and improve mood.[1] A small double-blind control study examined the effects of various doses of lemon balm, and found that self-reported 'calmness' was increased following even the lowest dose, but at the highest dose, alertness was reduced.[2] The extract of lemon balm was also found in one study to improve cognitive function and reduce agitation among people suffering from mild to moderate Alzheimer's.[3] Lemon balm is also used in aromatherapy. A preliminary study of people with severe dementia suggested that the aroma of lemon balm can reduce agitation in people with dementia.[4] Lemon balm also shows evidence of antimicrobial effects. The essential oil was found in one study to have radical-scavenging (antioxidant) properties, as well as anti-bacterial and anti-fungal effects against a number of different strains of bacteria and fungi.[5] The essential oil of lemon balm has also been found to have anti-viral effects against the HSV-2 (Herpes) virus, when used at non-toxic levels.[6] ",

            "about": ">Lemon verbena (Aloysia triphylla) is a plant with a strong lemon scent, similar to lemon balm, lemongrass, and lemon myrtle. Not closely related to lemongrass and lemon myrtle, it is only a distant relative of lemon balm, both being in different families in the order Lamiales. Lemon verbena is the most well-known of the verbenas, a family which includes a number of plants which mimic the aromas of various other plants, such as pineapple verbena (Nashia inaguensis), or Bushy Lippia (Lippia alba), a verbena native to Texas with many of the same chemical components of lemon verbena. Other verbenas are also used in herbal teas. Lemon verbena is frequently consumed as a tea on its own, and also blended as an ingredient in other teas, sometimes together with lemon balm and/or lemongrass. Although its aroma is in many respects similar to lemon balm and lemongrass, it nevertheless has its own distinct qualities. Lemon verbena, and other verbenas, in addition to their uses in tea, are also used to flavor a liqueur called verveine; because of this, teas sometimes reference the presence of verbena with the name 'verveine'. Most lemon verbena is sold in broken-leaf form, but whole-leaf lemon verbena is sometimes commercially available. Lemon verbena is easy to grow in temperate climates, and can also be used to brew a fresh herbal tea, without drying the herb. Lemon verbena is commonly used in Brazilian herbal medicine.[1] It has been found to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans, a type of yeast that can sometimes cause infections in humans.[1,2] It also was found to inhibit the growth of several potentially harmful species of bacteria.[2] One study found the three main chemical constituents to be geranial, nerol, and limonene.[2] These chemicals occur in lemongrass, lemon balm, and in lemons, although in very different proportions, which explains the similar but distinct aromas. The chemical citral, present in all three plants, has shown some promise for its potential to kill cancer cells.[3] ",

This whole-leaf lemon verbena from the ANC Farm is better than anything I've tried fresh or dried. This is to lemon verbena what a high grade Jade Oolong or Tie Guan Yin is to tea. Creamy smoothness. No bitterness, nor any astringency. Aroma of lemon and gingerbread. A molasses-like sweetness pervades. Leaves a sweet lemon taste on the palate, almost candy-like. Yet the cup is full-bodied and warming. Rarely am I so thoroughly impressed with an herb. Exquisite. If brewing in a single infusion, I recommend steeping for a long time (10-15 min.) for best results. The whole leaves are slow to infuse. I also tried making multiple infusions in a gaiwan, with good results. Tones of nutmeg came out in some of these infusions, that I did not notice when brewing all at once.

            "doc": ">Lemon verbena (Aloysia triphylla) is a plant with a strong lemon scent, similar to lemon balm, lemongrass, and lemon myrtle. Not closely related to lemongrass and lemon myrtle, it is only a distant relative of lemon balm, both being in different families in the order Lamiales. Lemon verbena is the most well-known of the verbenas, a family which includes a number of plants which mimic the aromas of various other plants, such as pineapple verbena (Nashia inaguensis), or Bushy Lippia (Lippia alba), a verbena native to Texas with many of the same chemical components of lemon verbena. Other verbenas are also used in herbal teas. Lemon verbena is frequently consumed as a tea on its own, and also blended as an ingredient in other teas, sometimes together with lemon balm and/or lemongrass. Although its aroma is in many respects similar to lemon balm and lemongrass, it nevertheless has its own distinct qualities. Lemon verbena, and other verbenas, in addition to their uses in tea, are also used to flavor a liqueur called verveine; because of this, teas sometimes reference the presence of verbena with the name 'verveine'. Most lemon verbena is sold in broken-leaf form, but whole-leaf lemon verbena is sometimes commercially available. Lemon verbena is easy to grow in temperate climates, and can also be used to brew a fresh herbal tea, without drying the herb. Lemon verbena is commonly used in Brazilian herbal medicine.[1] It has been found to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans, a type of yeast that can sometimes cause infections in humans.[1,2] It also was found to inhibit the growth of several potentially harmful species of bacteria.[2] One study found the three main chemical constituents to be geranial, nerol, and limonene.[2] These chemicals occur in lemongrass, lemon balm, and in lemons, although in very different proportions, which explains the similar but distinct aromas. The chemical citral, present in all three plants, has shown some promise for its potential to kill cancer cells.[3] Used about 2 tsp for my small pot..smell is like lemongrass..good and solid..the flavor has a strong mouthfeel...it covers the tongue... unique..finishes with a light sweetness that is pleasant.

As a fresh herb, it is also used in cooking, especially in Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian cuisine.There is significant evidence pointing to anti-cancer, antiviral, and antifungal activity of the essential oil of lemongrass. There is also some evidence of analgesic (pain-relieving) effects. However, as with many herbal teas, human studies of the health effects of lemongrass are sparse. It remains uncertain the degree to which these benefits carry through to tea drinkers. A mixture of chemicals, called citral, found in lemongrass as well as lemon balm, lemon verbena, and also lemon and other citrus fruit, was found to induce cell death in cancer cells, leading people to consume lemongrass tea as a treatment for cancer.[1] In vitro experiments have found the essential oil of lemongrass was shown to have strong antiviral activity, both against human viruses[2] and plant viruses such as tobacco mosaic virus.[3] In vitro studies have also found significant antifungal activity.[4] One study on rats found an infusion of lemongrass leaves to have analgesic (pain-killing) properties due to the chemical myrcene; this chemical was found to act by a mechanism different from that of aspirin-like drugs.[5] As many of the active ingredients in lemongrass are shared in common among other lemon-scented herbs, it is likely that the health benefits of lemongrass overlap somewhat with these other herbs.

                "I first had some of this drink when living in Miami almost 30 years ago, at a Salvadoran restaurant, without having tried linden tea of any sort before.

Meanwhile, a couple of basswood trees (American lindens) I had planted in my yard, for the shade more than the tea, began flowering; I have made some pretty good tea from their dried blossoms on a few occasions. Imagine my pleasant surprise, then, when I found a well-sealed little Ziploc-style bag in my pantry that still had a couple of Carmencita bags therein. They had been hidden at the bottom of a miscellaneous spice tin, in a dark place and still smelling fresh, despite the passage of a few years. The Carmencita tea still looked, smelled and tasted as I remembered: a nice, clear yellow/amber hue, rich, smooth, somewhat buttery, faintly reminiscent of a mix of chamomile, vanilla and mild anise, and creamier than the much younger, dried basswood flowers from the yard. The commercial, chopped, Spanish linden-flowers tea and the homegrown stuff taste just different enough to notice (Okie-grown basswood flowers yield a tea that's sharper and a little grassier), but it's a compliment to Carmencita that their years-old bags from European lindens held their own against relatively fresh, whole linden flowers (albeit from the variety native to North America). I probably won't buy linden tea anymore, since I can make as much at home as ever desired, but it was nice to rediscover this one for the sake of strolling memory lane, if nothing else. "

            "about": "Mint tea is one of the most popular and widely consumed types of herbal tea. It is used as tea on its own, in herbal tea blends, or mixed with green or black teas. Mint is not a single species of plant, but rather, a diverse plant family, Lamiaceae or Labiatae, that contains many plants called by the name of 'mint' as well as many culinary herbs, medicinal plants, and a broad variety of other plants, including many plants important in herbal teas, such as lemon balm and wild bergamot. Most true mints (and plants with the characteristic 'minty' aroma) belong to the metha genus, but a few plants in other genera also have minty aroma and bear the name 'mint' as well. Commercially available mint teas are almost exclusively either peppermint or spearmint, but there are numerous other mint varieties that are widely cultivated and sold in garden centers. Some other types of mint used in tea by home gardeners include apple mint or wooly mint, and peppermint cultivars like orange mint or chocolate mint. Some cultivated mints are individual species that occur in the wild-e.g. spearmint is Mentha spicata, whereas others, such as Peppermint, are hybrids of different species. Usually when the term 'mint' is used alone, it refers to spearmint, although for herbal teas, peppermint is more common. Most of the commercially available mint in the U.S. is either spearmint or peppermint. Apple mint, also called woolly mint or fuzzy mint, is particularly important in tea culture, as it is traditionally used for blending with green tea in Morocco. Mint tea can be made out of fresh or dried leaves. It is typically brewed with boiling water. The amount of leaf used typically varies by the species. Peppermint can have an overwhelmingly strong aroma, requiring less leaf to be used, whereas spearmint and other mints require more leaf. Mint teas make particularly good iced teas, as mint is often described as having a cool or refreshing quality. Many mints have numerous health benefits. Spearmint has significant antioxidant properties which have been shown to aid in the preservation of meat.[1] Mint tea has also been shown to enhance iron absorption.[2] Peppermint, spearmint, and Japanese mint have been shown to inhibit and kill a number of strains of harmful bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains such as MSRA.[3] Spearmint has also been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of harmful fungi.[4] While most mints are generally safe for consumption in food or beverages, some species of mint are toxic in large doses. Pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium), which has a pleasant minty aroma and makes a delicious tea, can cause liver damage and can even be lethal in a high enough dose, and is an ongoing source of poisoning.[5] ",

                "My first in-person conference this decade yielded a few new teas to try and to rate. This was one. As always with such 'freebies', value is based on the online and/or local store price. This is a tea I would call 'socially awkward' if it were a human. It hides quietly in the corner when you expect a meaningful interaction, and gets assertive when it normally shouldn't. The three listed ingredients are peppermint, spearmint and tarragon. The latter is a first for me in a commercially prepared tea, though I've made and enjoyed tea with chopped tarragon leaves in a strainer. It makes a nice complement to a somewhat weak mint tea (both in dry-bag and in-cup aromas, as well as taste). I'm not sure why the mints were so subdued in the bags I had, both at the conference and on home well water. The flavor balance was pleasant, just nowhere nearly strong enough. Interestingly, wet-bag scent offered the most potent sensation, with a great deal of mint oil still locked up in the leaves and wafting out when sniffed. It's a mystery why this is the case, given that I steeped for more than 5 minutes on a couple of the bags, and the leaves are fairly finely chopped. With the tarragon mixed in, this was a very enjoyable wet-bag breathing experience-borderline legit aromatherapy, and enough to bump the 'aroma' rating up a full star from what it would have been otherwise. A nice mint/tarragon kick also showed up in the aftertaste, more so than in the active-drinking flavor.",
                "I love spearmint herbal tea, but it's usually only available as a blend with peppermint. The only pure spearmint that I've been able to find locally in tea bags is Traditional Medicinals and they've been out of stock at the store where I buy them. I normally don't buy bulk because it's often stale, but since I was ordering online, I decided to gamble on a one-pound, wholesale-sized bag for $14.48. I'm glad I did. This is the best spearmint I've ever had. I'm sure it's at least partly because it's the freshest (the bulk bags are heat-sealed Mylar), but the herb is also visually higher quality than other brands I've had. I've even grown fresh spearmint before and this is better. The dry herb is pungent. It smells overpoweringly like spearmint oil with a light vegetal background, like grass or alfalfa. I examined the dry herb and saw no sign of the woody stems often present in bulk mints. The tea bags I'm used to are filled with 1.5g of herb, so I weighed 3g for my 16oz mug. The liquor steeps to a deep amber-green and once again, the scent is powerful. The combination of flavor and aroma is perfect. The flavor of spearmint oil dominates, but in the background is the light vegetal or chlorophyll bitterness that I enjoy. I couldn't detect, even faintly, any of the catnip skunkiness often present in mint. After steeping, the hydrated leaves are recognizable as spearmint and look like fresh leaves that went through a lawnmower. There was also no sand or grit in the bottom of my mug after I finished drinking it. Without hyperbole, this is the best spearmint herb I've ever had and at less than $1 per ounce, the least expensive. I've transferred the contents of the bag to airtight glass jars to hopefully preserve the freshness until I can drink 300 cups of it, but I'll have broken even compared to the price of my usual brand of tea bags if I can get through 50.

                "The version I have simply is called 'Peppermint' without the 'Purely' or 'Soothing' parts, though I have seen the white-box 'Soothing' version in stores too. The ingredient in both simply is peppermint leaves. I don't know if it has been wholly renamed, or if this is just a relabeling of the same tea for different markets or audiences, as Teekanne commonly does. Either way, it's the same actual product. Teekanne doesn't skimp on quantity or quality here. The dry bags already were 1/3 to 1/2 full, and swelled up very nicely when steeping. Finely chopped leaves emitted a lot of flavor and scent, both in the dry bag and in-cup, and rendered a darkly translucent brown-green liquid quickly. Given the potential for imported products like this to travel far and sit on a shelf for a long time, its fresh aroma and flavor were a peasant surprise. The taste is robust, in the upper quartile of peppermint teas I've had, with more body and sweetness than many.

            "doc": "Mint tea is one of the most popular and widely consumed types of herbal tea. It is used as tea on its own, in herbal tea blends, or mixed with green or black teas. Mint is not a single species of plant, but rather, a diverse plant family, Lamiaceae or Labiatae, that contains many plants called by the name of 'mint' as well as many culinary herbs, medicinal plants, and a broad variety of other plants, including many plants important in herbal teas, such as lemon balm and wild bergamot. Most true mints (and plants with the characteristic 'minty' aroma) belong to the metha genus, but a few plants in other genera also have minty aroma and bear the name 'mint' as well. Commercially available mint teas are almost exclusively either peppermint or spearmint, but there are numerous other mint varieties that are widely cultivated and sold in garden centers. Some other types of mint used in tea by home gardeners include apple mint or wooly mint, and peppermint cultivars like orange mint or chocolate mint. Some cultivated mints are individual species that occur in the wild-e.g. spearmint is Mentha spicata, whereas others, such as Peppermint, are hybrids of different species. Usually when the term 'mint' is used alone, it refers to spearmint, although for herbal teas, peppermint is more common. Most of the commercially available mint in the U.S. is either spearmint or peppermint. Apple mint, also called woolly mint or fuzzy mint, is particularly important in tea culture, as it is traditionally used for blending with green tea in Morocco. Mint tea can be made out of fresh or dried leaves. It is typically brewed with boiling water. The amount of leaf used typically varies by the species. Peppermint can have an overwhelmingly strong aroma, requiring less leaf to be used, whereas spearmint and other mints require more leaf. Mint teas make particularly good iced teas, as mint is often described as having a cool or refreshing quality. Many mints have numerous health benefits. Spearmint has significant antioxidant properties which have been shown to aid in the preservation of meat.[1] Mint tea has also been shown to enhance iron absorption.[2] Peppermint, spearmint, and Japanese mint have been shown to inhibit and kill a number of strains of harmful bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains such as MSRA.[3] Spearmint has also been shown to inhibit the growth of a variety of harmful fungi.[4] While most mints are generally safe for consumption in food or beverages, some species of mint are toxic in large doses. Pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium), which has a pleasant minty aroma and makes a delicious tea, can cause liver damage and can even be lethal in a high enough dose, and is an ongoing source of poisoning.[5] My first in-person conference this decade yielded a few new teas to try and to rate. This was one. As always with such 'freebies', value is based on the online and/or local store price. This is a tea I would call 'socially awkward' if it were a human. It hides quietly in the corner when you expect a meaningful interaction, and gets assertive when it normally shouldn't. The three listed ingredients are peppermint, spearmint and tarragon. The latter is a first for me in a commercially prepared tea, though I've made and enjoyed tea with chopped tarragon leaves in a strainer. It makes a nice complement to a somewhat weak mint tea (both in dry-bag and in-cup aromas, as well as taste). I'm not sure why the mints were so subdued in the bags I had, both at the conference and on home well water. The flavor balance was pleasant, just nowhere nearly strong enough. Interestingly, wet-bag scent offered the most potent sensation, with a great deal of mint oil still locked up in the leaves and wafting out when sniffed. It's a mystery why this is the case, given that I steeped for more than 5 minutes on a couple of the bags, and the leaves are fairly finely chopped. With the tarragon mixed in, this was a very enjoyable wet-bag breathing experience-borderline legit aromatherapy, and enough to bump the 'aroma' rating up a full star from what it would have been otherwise. A nice mint/tarragon kick also showed up in the aftertaste, more so than in the active-drinking flavor. I love spearmint herbal tea, but it's usually only available as a blend with peppermint. The only pure spearmint that I've been able to find locally in tea bags is Traditional Medicinals and they've been out of stock at the store where I buy them. I normally don't buy bulk because it's often stale, but since I was ordering online, I decided to gamble on a one-pound, wholesale-sized bag for $14.48. I'm glad I did. This is the best spearmint I've ever had. I'm sure it's at least partly because it's the freshest (the bulk bags are heat-sealed Mylar), but the herb is also visually higher quality than other brands I've had. I've even grown fresh spearmint before and this is better. The dry herb is pungent. It smells overpoweringly like spearmint oil with a light vegetal background, like grass or alfalfa. I examined the dry herb and saw no sign of the woody stems often present in bulk mints. The tea bags I'm used to are filled with 1.5g of herb, so I weighed 3g for my 16oz mug. The liquor steeps to a deep amber-green and once again, the scent is powerful. The combination of flavor and aroma is perfect. The flavor of spearmint oil dominates, but in the background is the light vegetal or chlorophyll bitterness that I enjoy. I couldn't detect, even faintly, any of the catnip skunkiness often present in mint. After steeping, the hydrated leaves are recognizable as spearmint and look like fresh leaves that went through a lawnmower. There was also no sand or grit in the bottom of my mug after I finished drinking it. Without hyperbole, this is the best spearmint herb I've ever had and at less than $1 per ounce, the least expensive. I've transferred the contents of the bag to airtight glass jars to hopefully preserve the freshness until I can drink 300 cups of it, but I'll have broken even compared to the price of my usual brand of tea bags if I can get through 50.  The version I have simply is called 'Peppermint' without the 'Purely' or 'Soothing' parts, though I have seen the white-box 'Soothing' version in stores too. The ingredient in both simply is peppermint leaves. I don't know if it has been wholly renamed, or if this is just a relabeling of the same tea for different markets or audiences, as Teekanne commonly does. Either way, it's the same actual product. Teekanne doesn't skimp on quantity or quality here. The dry bags already were 1/3 to 1/2 full, and swelled up very nicely when steeping. Finely chopped leaves emitted a lot of flavor and scent, both in the dry bag and in-cup, and rendered a darkly translucent brown-green liquid quickly. Given the potential for imported products like this to travel far and sit on a shelf for a long time, its fresh aroma and flavor were a peasant surprise. The taste is robust, in the upper quartile of peppermint teas I've had, with more body and sweetness than many. Even though the cost is higher than most domestic peppermint teas per bag, online but especially in the sort of German-food/world-market type stores that sell it retail, I won't dock 'value' too severely because the quality is quite good, and boxes still contain 20 bags instead of 18 or 16.

            "about": "Peppermint is a type of mint, a hybrid or cross between spearmint (Mentha spicata) and watermint (Mentha aquatica). Besides its use in herbal tea, it is a common flavoring in candy, often paired with chocolate. Peppermint is the most widely-available mint in herbal tea, although it is not necessarily the 'typical' or 'default' mint; because of its distinctive aroma it is usually called by its full name rather than referred to generically as 'mint', which usually references spearmint. The aroma of peppermint is familiar to most people in the U.S., as it is the flavoring of candy canes and other peppermint candy. The aroma is usually described as fresh and invigorating, and peppermint also creates a powerful cooling sensation, stronger than other mints. Peppermint has one of the most intense aromas of all the herbs commonly used in teas. Even a small amount of peppermint leaf added to an herbal blend can drown out other ingredients. Because of its dominating nature, peppermint is less versatile than other mints in blends, and it is thus either used on its own, or in very small quantities. Common blending ingredients include chamomile and hibiscus. Peppermint does not blend with true tea (green or black tea) as other mints, although it is sometimes used in such blends. Peppermint tea is traditionally used for a variety of purposes, the most common of which is to treat digestive upset. A 2006 meta analysis of peppermint concluded that in vitro, peppermint has strong antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, and antitumor activity, and that there is some evidence that peppermint relaxes the digestive tract. Peppermint oil has also been studied for treating irritable bowel syndrome(IBS), but there was a lack of clinical trials of peppermint tea and limited studies of peppermint leaf. A 2014 review found that peppermint oil was safe and effective for treating IBS, but again this study was on thei oil, not the herbal tea. Owing to its antioxidants, peppermint tea is one of many herbal teas that has been studied with promising results for its potential to lower breast cancer risk. The plant and its essential oil have also been used as an antiseptic due to its antimicrobial properties. High doses of peppermint are toxic. The plant can be hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver) and nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys), perhaps due to the chemical pulegone, which is also a neurotoxin and can induce a coma. There is even one case of a woman nearly killed by ingesting peppermint oil. An herbal infusion of the plant, though, is much safer than the pure oil. At lower doses, possible side effects include heartburn, digestive upset, and headache. When used as a treatment for IBS, heartburn was a relatively common side-effect. Peppermint is a sterile hybrid, meaning that it cannot reproduce by seeds. It can persist in the wild in vegetative colonies, spreading by underground runners. Wild populations in Eurasia can be the result of natural hybridization where the range of spearmint and watermint overlap, but most populations are escapes or populations of formerly cultivated plants. Most peppermint is easily identified by its distinctive smell, although a few unusual cultivars like 'Orange Mint' or 'Chocolate Mint' smell very different. Like all true mints (Mentha sp.), peppermint has square stems, opposite leaves, and a neat, symmetrical growth habit, with many stems rising from underground runners. The shape of the leaves, however, is more variable across the different peppermint cultivars than the natural variation that exists within most pure species of mint. Many, but not all varieties of peppermint have reddish-purple stems, and sometimes the leaves have a reddish-purple tinge, usually strongest along the veins and around the edges. Many peppermint plants have long, narrow leaves like spearmint, but some have shorter, more rounded leaves. The growing requirements of peppermint are similar to spearmint, and it shares that plant's aggressive growth habit. Peppermint thrives in moist temperate climates, where it does best in part shade and moist soil rich in organic matter. Peppermint is an aggressive plant, but when grown together, spearmint sometimes out-competes peppermint; this is especially true of some of the peppermint cultivars selected for their particular aromas. But more vigorous varieties of peppermint still outcompete many garden plants, and are safest to grow in containers for this reason. New peppermint cultivars can be created by cross-pollinating spearmint and watermint, but propagation that preserves the distinct aromatic profile of a given plant must be done by cutting. Like other mints, peppermint is easy to grow from stem cuttings. Cuttings can be placed in a glass of water and allowed to root in water, then later planted, or they can be buried horizontally in soil.",

                "The weird thing about TEViVE teas is that the teabags contain half of the tea or herb or whatever of other brands. The flavored black teas each contain one gram of tea instead of two. The peppermint teabags contain .6 gram while my box of Stash teabags have a full gram. Whenever I make this, I use twice as many teabags as I otherwise would (I generally make a 16 ounce mug, so I use four teabags). That said, the TEViVE product is quite good quality. The peppermint tastes fresh, clean, and slightly herbal with a good dose of menthol. Since this brand is for sale at Dollar Tree stores, each box costs a dollar. Two boxes contains the same amount of peppermint as a single box of most grocery store brands and is still less expensive. Unfortunately, that comes with twice as much packaging which results in twice as much waste. That bothers me enough to cost a star.",
                "Once again, I drank a Twinings product, wondering how this brand gained enough of a reputation or loyalty to have lasted so long. The peppermint in these bags wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Lots of stems too! It reminded me a lot of cheap/knock-off store brands or some of the lower-quality food-service peppermint offerings, except most of those I've had were still a little stronger in aroma and flavor. Even 'Great Value' (Wal-Mart's store brand) was quite noticeably stronger and richer in every way. The dry-bag smell was faint, and seemed to lack the sharp, cool vibrancy of the best dried peppermints I've sniffed in tea bags, as if the essential oils long since had evaporated away. This, despite the bags being individually sealed in plastic that bore a silvery inner reflective coating, and in turn, the box containing them being shrink-wrapped. It wasn't a surprise, therefore, when the drink turned out to be well-colored, but very mild on both flavor and scent. Unusually, so was the post-steeping squeezed bag; it lacked the crisp coolness one gets from sniffing the best peppermint wet bags as well. I don't recommend this product unless you can obtain it free or very cheap, and want to add just a faint, background peppermint flavor to some other hot beverage, such as hot chocolate or green tea-and even then it may require more than one bag per cup."

But this sort of practice, even if the weight of the tea is given on the box, is deceptive. For that they get docked on value, despite the cheap up-front price. One-litre pot at home, made from finely chopped leaves of peppermint. Pours nearly clear darkish brown (against white china). Clear aroma of, well, peppermint, but without any aggressive notes, despite the fact that I brewed the tea for 10 minutes. Clean flavour of peppermint - again, not aggressive but definitely undisturbed and refreshing. Ditto palate. I like the moderate strength of the tea. The few other peppermint teas I remember having had were either intolerably intensive or just bland. This one is definitely not. It tastes good as an evening alternative to caffeinated teas, without having the directly soporific effect of herbal blends based on or including the valerian root. Fair price (38 DKK per 100 g). It looks like becoming my staple of the kind. 7 4 4 70 10 g / l; 100 C; 10 min. Review #185  The weird thing about TEViVE teas is that the teabags contain half of the tea or herb or whatever of other brands. The flavored black teas each contain one gram of tea instead of two. The peppermint teabags contain .6 gram while my box of Stash teabags have a full gram. Whenever I make this, I use twice as many teabags as I otherwise would (I generally make a 16 ounce mug, so I use four teabags). That said, the TEViVE product is quite good quality. The peppermint tastes fresh, clean, and slightly herbal with a good dose of menthol. Since this brand is for sale at Dollar Tree stores, each box costs a dollar. Two boxes contains the same amount of peppermint as a single box of most grocery store brands and is still less expensive. Unfortunately, that comes with twice as much packaging which results in twice as much waste. That bothers me enough to cost a star. Once again, I drank a Twinings product, wondering how this brand gained enough of a reputation or loyalty to have lasted so long. The peppermint in these bags wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. Lots of stems too! It reminded me a lot of cheap/knock-off store brands or some of the lower-quality food-service peppermint offerings, except most of those I've had were still a little stronger in aroma and flavor. Even 'Great Value' (Wal-Mart's store brand) was quite noticeably stronger and richer in every way. The dry-bag smell was faint, and seemed to lack the sharp, cool vibrancy of the best dried peppermints I've sniffed in tea bags, as if the essential oils long since had evaporated away. This, despite the bags being individually sealed in plastic that bore a silvery inner reflective coating, and in turn, the box containing them being shrink-wrapped. It wasn't a surprise, therefore, when the drink turned out to be well-colored, but very mild on both flavor and scent. Unusually, so was the post-steeping squeezed bag; it lacked the crisp coolness one gets from sniffing the best peppermint wet bags as well. I don't recommend this product unless you can obtain it free or very cheap, and want to add just a faint, background peppermint flavor to some other hot beverage, such as hot chocolate or green tea-and even then it may require more than one bag per cup."

            "about": "Spearmint is a species of mint, Mentha spicata, and the most common type of mint used in mint tea. When people refer to 'mint tea' without specifying a type of mint, spearmint is the most common kind referenced, although peppermint is actually more popular and abundant in the market of herbal teas. The aroma of spearmint can be described as clean, fresh, and cooling, although it lacks the intense cooling quality of peppermint. Compared to peppermint, the aroma is softer and less piercing. The flavor is predominately bitter, although depending on the variety, harvest time, and preparation, it is possible to prepare spearmint tea so as to minimize bitterness. Spearmint is a versatile flavoring, blending well with savory foods as well as sweets. In herbal teas, it is commonly blended with a wide range of ingredients, including peppermint and other mints, chamomile, and the various lemon-scented herbs like lemon balm and lemongrass. Spearmint is commercially available both as a fresh herb (at groceries, produce markets, and farm stands) and a dried herb (from tea companies and bulk herb companies). The fresh herb, including leaves and stems, can be brewed as an herbal tea or added to tea; spearmint tea brewed from fresh leaves has a more vegetal flavor, with a hint of cooked greens in the flavor. It is also common to blend spearmint with true teas. In parts of the middle east, it is common to brew strong black tea with spearmint or a related mint with a similar aroma. In Morocco, gunpowder green tea is often blended with spearmint or other mints. On RateTea we have separate categories for green tea with mint and black tea with mint. Whether or not the tea itself is brewed with mint, a sprig of spearmint leaves are a common addition to freshly brewed iced tea. Many mints can be substituted for spearmint. One of the most similar in aroma is apple mint or wooly mint. Although peppermint is a hybrid of spearmint with another species, it has a very different aroma and does not make a good substitute as other species and varieties that are less closely related.Mentha spicata has a wide native range, from Europe to Asia, south to the Middle East and Himalayas. It grows well in moist temperate climates. In the wild, it prefers wetlands, sometimes growing on moister ground outside wetlands. Mint family plants are easily recognized by their square stems and neat, symmetrical growth habit. The true mints, Mentha sp., form patches of upright stems from underground runners, contrasting with the clump-forming habit of some other plants of the family. Spearmint is identified from other common mentha species and varieties by its sharply serrated leaves, usually completely hairless stems and leaves, and uniform green color (lacking red/brown or variegation). Growing spearmint is easy in moist temperate climates. The plant does best in part shade, and moist soil rich in organic material, but it is adaptable. It is an aggressive plant, often choking out other plants in a garden, and spreading through underground runners. For this reason, it is common for gardeners to grow it in containers. Propagation of spearmint is easiest by cutting; the plant is comparatively much more difficult to grow from seed. Cuttings can be placed in a glass of water and allowed to root in water, then later planted, or they can be buried horizontally in soil. Both methods are easy and effective.",

The only pure spearmint that I've been able to find locally in tea bags is Traditional Medicinals and they've been out of stock at the store where I buy them. I normally don't buy bulk because it's often stale, but since I was ordering online, I decided to gamble on a one-pound, wholesale-sized bag for $14.48. I'm glad I did. This is the best spearmint I've ever had. I'm sure it's at least partly because it's the freshest (the bulk bags are heat-sealed Mylar), but the herb is also visually higher quality than other brands I've had. I've even grown fresh spearmint before and this is better. The dry herb is pungent. It smells overpoweringly like spearmint oil with a light vegetal background, like grass or alfalfa. I examined the dry herb and saw no sign of the woody stems often present in bulk mints. The tea bags I'm used to are filled with 1.5g of herb, so I weighed 3g for my 16oz mug. The liquor steeps to a deep amber-green and once again, the scent is powerful. The combination of flavor and aroma is perfect. The flavor of spearmint oil dominates, but in the background is the light vegetal or chlorophyll bitterness that I enjoy. I couldn't detect, even faintly, any of the catnip skunkiness often present in mint. After steeping, the hydrated leaves are recognizable as spearmint and look like fresh leaves that went through a lawnmower. There was also no sand or grit in the bottom of my mug after I finished drinking it. Without hyperbole, this is the best spearmint herb I've ever had and at less than $1 per ounce, the least expensive. I've transferred the contents of the bag to airtight glass jars to hopefully preserve the freshness until I can drink 300 cups of it, but I'll have broken even compared to the price of my usual brand of tea bags if I can get through 50.

            "about": "Chamomile, also spelled camomile, is an herb widely used in herbal teas, both on its own and in blends. Although called 'tea', it is not closely related to tea, and is rarely blended with true teas. Chamomile tea is caffeine-free and is often described as having a calming or soothing quality. Its aroma is floral and fruity, and it tends to have a bitter aftertaste. It is popular as a bedtime drink. Because chamomile is so frequently used in herbal blends, and many herbal teas containing chamomile and other ingredients are marketed as 'chamomile' or 'chamomile tea', the pure herb is sometimes labeled pure chamomile tea or pure camomile tea. On RateTea, this category is used exclusively for pure chamomile, containing no other ingredients. We classify any blends containing chamomile together with other herbs under chamomile blend. The pure herb is available both from tea companies and bulk herb companies; on this site, we list both such sources for review. Chamomile is not a single species, but rather a complex of similar species in the daisy family. Matricaria chamomilla or Matricaria recutita, often called German chamomile, is a species native to Europe, and is the chamomile most commonly used in herbal teas--unless otherwise specified, when you see chamomile for sale it usually refers to this species. This plant can be cultivated in a wide range of climates, and is commercially cultivated in places as varied as Germany to Guatemala and Egypt. Matricaria discoidea, also called Pineapple weed is a closely related species native to North America and Northeast Asia, which can also be used for an herbal tea. It has an aroma that resembles chamomile, but has a distinct pineapple-like aroma as well. Brett of Black Dragon Tea Bar gives an account of brewing pineapple weed, and mentions that he thought it had a relaxing effect. Pineapple weed is commercially cultivated in Canada. The Matricaria genus also contains numerous other less well-known species. Roman chamomile, Anthemis nobilis, is another similar species, less closely related, and is less commonly used in herbal teas, but has numerous traditional medicinal uses. Although it is not in the same genus, Roman chamomile looks more similar to German chamomile than some of the members of the Matricaria genus look to each other.Read more about chamomile and sleep. Chamomile has long been thought to have a relaxing effect. A study published in 2001 found that drinking chamomile tea was more relaxing than hot water, measured by observing heart rate, skin temperature, and other physiological indicators of relaxation.[1] Recent scientific research points to a number of other health benefits of chamomile as well. A 2006 review of the scientific literature summarized that chamomile tea has been found to have moderate antioxidant and antimicrobial effects, and there is some evidence that it has potent anti-inflammatory activity, as well as antimutagenic, cholesterol-lowering, antispasmodic, and anti-anxiety activity.[2] Antioxidants are common among most teas and herbal teas. A 2008 study suggested that chamomile had the effect of lowering blood sugar, and could be useful for preventing or treating diabetes.[3] Chamomile is sometimes recommended as a remedy for acid reflux or heartburn. The main known side-effect of chamomile is that the herb can act as a blood thinner, and is one of many natural substances known to interact with the prescription blood-thinner Warfarin (Coumadin). Chamomile contains the chemical coumarin, which is chemically and biologically similar to Warfarin/Coumadin, and which can be dangerous when consumed in very high concentrations. However, the amounts in chamomile tea are small and safe for beverage use in normal, healthy people. While not common, there are documented cases of severe allergic reactions to Chamomile. Chamomile is in the aster/daisy family, which also contains common allergens such as ragweed and mugwort; allergies to these plants can cause cross-reactivity and produce a reaction.[4] It is thus important for those with known allergies or risk of allergies to plants in this family to exercise caution with the use of chamomile tea or any products containing chamomile.

                "Value-wise, I've found that cheaper chamomile really is best much of the time, since the quality doesn't seem to vary greatly from one brand to another. So when I run low or out, I just grab something inexpensive when I see it. Such was the case here, and I rate 'value' highly for two reasons: 1) The tea was on sale for a couple bucks in a Hispanic store in Dallas, and 2) My box had 24 bags (!), which reverses the modern 'shrinkflation' trend of going with 18 or 16 bags in what used to be (and still are the same outer sizes as) 20-bag boxes. Each tea bag comes in a plastic wrapper, with a string wound around inside the bag, and a tag right next to the bag that you first use to pull enough of the string out to be able to drape it over the cup. All righty, then. The dry-bag aroma was pleasant, just straight chamomile. However, the scent came alive when pouring the boiling water into the cup, such that a sweet, somewhat creamy, sharp scent wafted a foot or more above the cup before dispersing. Even after 5 or more minutes of steeping, the color never darkens from medium-golden (faintly amber), but don't let that offer the impression of a weak tea. It's not. In flavor, it doesn't have anywhere nearly the richly buttery character of McCormick-my gold standard for chamomile-but it's smooth, clean, reasonably robust, just a little astringent, and doesn't leave as much of an aftertaste as many others. This puts it solidly above average for chamomile tea, in my book. Also, the squeezed wet bag still smells appropriately fragrant, and isn't somewhat slimy in texture like some other chamomiles can get at this stage. All in all, this is a nice, worthwhile product.",
                "The only other reviews so far give it 90 and a 100 points, so it looks like this is a contrasting view. I found it to be both a little bitter and bland, without much floral flavor or aroma. I got a sachet of this as a freebie with another order, so they may have been giving away some out-of-date product. ",
                "Let's play tea detective. This product was a bit perplexing-not because of anything having to do with its own properties, but because it took some digging to find exactly this stuff online. Lipton sells a 'Relax' branded chamomile in retail-on its site and in some stores-but I don't know if this is the same stuff, more simply named. RateTea has a retired Lipton chamomile blend already, but this one is solely chamomile flowers. On the back of the 'Not Labeled for Retail Sale' wrapper was a web address for parent company Unilever's food-service site, deep within which I finally found this specific offering...but only as part of a bulk variety pack. Since I got it at a cafeteria along with some of the same others, I'll rather safely assume this is the food-service chamomile. 'Value' is rated based on the food-service (bulk) pricing, as if you really wanted to order a bunch for home (or business) use, not what you'd pay in an eatery for a cup, as I did. As for the beverage itself, it's decent in aroma and flavor-nowhere nearly as rich and buttery as McCormick's outstanding offering, and somewhat flat at the front of the mouth. Still, it's better than several other chamomiles I've gotten as restaurants, hotels and conferences. Flowers are chopped up very finely in the bag, so the liquid turns a fairly rich yellow-amber quickly, then tan. I've found that chamomile aftertastes generally linger longer than most other tea/tisane types, but this one clings to the sides and back of the tongue for an exceptionally long time. Curiously, when squeezing the wet bag, it doesn't get clumpy and mildly slimy like many other chamomile teas. Instead, it stays rather granular and easily can be worked loose again while damp. Overall, if you find this at your next meeting, hotel, or on some plane or ship, you certainly could do worse for a chamomile. ",
                "Though tagged here as retired, it seems McCormick has unretired it, for as of late October 2019, it is available in 10- or 25-count boxes on Amazon, and the web presences of big brick-and-mortar store chains like Wal-Mart, Safeway, Kroger and H-E-B. I got some in person at a regional Oklahoma chain today, for a little over two bucks, in the Hispanic foods section (this version is made in Mexico and has bilingual labeling). Good thing I found it too, as we almost were out of pure chamomile tea, and I usually can find some fairly inexpensively in-store somewhere. So how is it? The dry bag is small-a pouch about 1.5 x 1.5 inches horizontally-but sealed in an individual plastic wrapper, with a very strong chamomile aroma that hints at what's to come. The in-cup color is clear and golden, as you'd expect with pure chamomile. The taste is a sweet, rich, creamy, buttery, quite delicious variety of the herb that clearly has been well-grown and -selected. I was surprised at the high quality. Regardless of the seemingly small dry-bag volume, the wet bag fluffs up nicely, pillow-like, with no wasted space. Despite leaving a lot of flavor in-cup, the wet bag still has a rich aroma making it worth breathing through. I hope McCormick doesn't really discontinue this product; it's probably the best chamomile tea I've had.",
                "This is good quality chamomile. After opening the heavy paper and foil pouch, the dry teabag has a much richer aroma than most chamomile that I've had. The contents of the teabag looks ground up and entirely flower parts with no stems or leaves. It brews up a deep gold with a slight greenish hue. The aroma of the liquor is 'thick' and has almost a fudgy sweetness. The mouthfeel is rich and it has a sweet, nutty flavor reminiscent of a light pastry, like baklava. Since I rated the TEvIVE chamomile so highly a little over a week ago, I decided to brew a cup so I could compare them side-by-side. The Taylors of Harrogate is superior, even when doubling up the TEvIVE teabags to account for the lesser amount in each one. This is probably the best chamomile I've had so far. I've always kept chamomile tea around and enjoyed it, but I'm starting to think that I'd fallen into the trap that many Lipton tea drinkers fall into. I didn't like it enough to spend for really good quality, but didn't realize how much better the good stuff is. Indeed, the one I'm drinking now was a sample and I probably wouldn't have paid the $4.79 to buy a 20 count box. It's about twice the price of the chamomile teas I've been buying and probably worth it. "

Chamomile contains the chemical coumarin, which is chemically and biologically similar to Warfarin/Coumadin, and which can be dangerous when consumed in very high concentrations. However, the amounts in chamomile tea are small and safe for beverage use in normal, healthy people. While not common, there are documented cases of severe allergic reactions to Chamomile. Chamomile is in the aster/daisy family, which also contains common allergens such as ragweed and mugwort; allergies to these plants can cause cross-reactivity and produce a reaction.[4] It is thus important for those with known allergies or risk of allergies to plants in this family to exercise caution with the use of chamomile tea or any products containing chamomile. Value-wise, I've found that cheaper chamomile really is best much of the time, since the quality doesn't seem to vary greatly from one brand to another. So when I run low or out, I just grab something inexpensive when I see it. Such was the case here, and I rate 'value' highly for two reasons: 1) The tea was on sale for a couple bucks in a Hispanic store in Dallas, and 2) My box had 24 bags (!), which reverses the modern 'shrinkflation' trend of going with 18 or 16 bags in what used to be (and still are the same outer sizes as) 20-bag boxes. Each tea bag comes in a plastic wrapper, with a string wound around inside the bag, and a tag right next to the bag that you first use to pull enough of the string out to be able to drape it over the cup. All righty, then. The dry-bag aroma was pleasant, just straight chamomile. However, the scent came alive when pouring the boiling water into the cup, such that a sweet, somewhat creamy, sharp scent wafted a foot or more above the cup before dispersing. Even after 5 or more minutes of steeping, the color never darkens from medium-golden (faintly amber), but don't let that offer the impression of a weak tea. It's not. In flavor, it doesn't have anywhere nearly the richly buttery character of McCormick-my gold standard for chamomile-but it's smooth, clean, reasonably robust, just a little astringent, and doesn't leave as much of an aftertaste as many others. This puts it solidly above average for chamomile tea, in my book. Also, the squeezed wet bag still smells appropriately fragrant, and isn't somewhat slimy in texture like some other chamomiles can get at this stage. All in all, this is a nice, worthwhile product. The only other reviews so far give it 90 and a 100 points, so it looks like this is a contrasting view. I found it to be both a little bitter and bland, without much floral flavor or aroma. I got a sachet of this as a freebie with another order, so they may have been giving away some out-of-date product.  Let's play tea detective. This product was a bit perplexing-not because of anything having to do with its own properties, but because it took some digging to find exactly this stuff online. Lipton sells a 'Relax' branded chamomile in retail-on its site and in some stores-but I don't know if this is the same stuff, more simply named. RateTea has a retired Lipton chamomile blend already, but this one is solely chamomile flowers. On the back of the 'Not Labeled for Retail Sale' wrapper was a web address for parent company Unilever's food-service site, deep within which I finally found this specific offering...but only as part of a bulk variety pack. Since I got it at a cafeteria along with some of the same others, I'll rather safely assume this is the food-service chamomile. 'Value' is rated based on the food-service (bulk) pricing, as if you really wanted to order a bunch for home (or business) use, not what you'd pay in an eatery for a cup, as I did. As for the beverage itself, it's decent in aroma and flavor-nowhere nearly as rich and buttery as McCormick's outstanding offering, and somewhat flat at the front of the mouth. Still, it's better than several other chamomiles I've gotten as restaurants, hotels and conferences. Flowers are chopped up very finely in the bag, so the liquid turns a fairly rich yellow-amber quickly, then tan. I've found that chamomile aftertastes generally linger longer than most other tea/tisane types, but this one clings to the sides and back of the tongue for an exceptionally long time. Curiously, when squeezing the wet bag, it doesn't get clumpy and mildly slimy like many other chamomile teas. Instead, it stays rather granular and easily can be worked loose again while damp. Overall, if you find this at your next meeting, hotel, or on some plane or ship, you certainly could do worse for a chamomile.  Though tagged here as retired, it seems McCormick has unretired it, for as of late October 2019, it is available in 10- or 25-count boxes on Amazon, and the web presences of big brick-and-mortar store chains like Wal-Mart, Safeway, Kroger and H-E-B. I got some in person at a regional Oklahoma chain today, for a little over two bucks, in the Hispanic foods section (this version is made in Mexico and has bilingual labeling). Good thing I found it too, as we almost were out of pure chamomile tea, and I usually can find some fairly inexpensively in-store somewhere. So how is it? The dry bag is small-a pouch about 1.5 x 1.5 inches horizontally-but sealed in an individual plastic wrapper, with a very strong chamomile aroma that hints at what's to come. The in-cup color is clear and golden, as you'd expect with pure chamomile. The taste is a sweet, rich, creamy, buttery, quite delicious variety of the herb that clearly has been well-grown and -selected. I was surprised at the high quality. Regardless of the seemingly small dry-bag volume, the wet bag fluffs up nicely, pillow-like, with no wasted space. Despite leaving a lot of flavor in-cup, the wet bag still has a rich aroma making it worth breathing through. I hope McCormick doesn't really discontinue this product; it's probably the best chamomile tea I've had. This is good quality chamomile. After opening the heavy paper and foil pouch, the dry teabag has a much richer aroma than most chamomile that I've had. The contents of the teabag looks ground up and entirely flower parts with no stems or leaves. It brews up a deep gold with a slight greenish hue. The aroma of the liquor is 'thick' and has almost a fudgy sweetness. The mouthfeel is rich and it has a sweet, nutty flavor reminiscent of a light pastry, like baklava. Since I rated the TEvIVE chamomile so highly a little over a week ago, I decided to brew a cup so I could compare them side-by-side. The Taylors of Harrogate is superior, even when doubling up the TEvIVE teabags to account for the lesser amount in each one. This is probably the best chamomile I've had so far. I've always kept chamomile tea around and enjoyed it, but I'm starting to think that I'd fallen into the trap that many Lipton tea drinkers fall into. I didn't like it enough to spend for really good quality, but didn't realize how much better the good stuff is. Indeed, the one I'm drinking now was a sample and I probably wouldn't have paid the $4.79 to buy a 20 count box. It's about twice the price of the chamomile teas I've been buying and probably worth it. "

            "about": "Rooibos is a type of herbal tea made from the Aspalathus linearis plant, a legume native to South Africa. It is often called South African red tea or just red tea, owing to the red color of both the dry leaf and brewed tea. This is distinct from the other use of the term 'red tea' to refer to black teas, in reference to the Chinese term 'hong cha'. Rooibos is also called redbush tea and sometimes just bush tea, although it is distinct from honeybush, a similar tea from the same region made out of a different plant, also a legume. Rooibos has a distinctive flavor and aroma, often described as earthy and fruity; it is less bitter than most black tea, but is often described as being among the herbal teas that most closely resembles black tea. Like most herbal teas, it contains no caffeine. Rooibos is frequently used in herbal tea blends, often as a base to impart body or richness. We list herbal teas with rooibos as the dominant ingredient as flavored rooibos. Common ingredients or flavors for blending include vanilla and strawberry, as these blend well with the natural aroma of the herb. Less commonly, the herb can be scented with bergamot to produce a rooibos Earl Grey, or blended with spices to yield rooibos chai or spiced rooibos, a reference to masala chai. Rooibos is also frequently mixed with black, green, or other teas together with other herbal ingredients or flavorings; such blends are listed under miscellaneous blends. Rooibos is grown exclusively in a small region of South Africa's West Cape province where it is native. Both stems and leaves are harvested. In the traditional production method, which makes up the bulk of production, the herb is allowed to oxidize in heaps, in a process somewhat analagous to how black tea is produced. All finished rooibos has a fine texture, owing to the very small needle-like leaves of the plant, although there is a range of grades with different coarseness. Higher grades have a higher ratio of leaf to stem. More recently, however, people have begun to manufacture green rooibos, which is produced in a process similar to green tea, more similar to Japanese steamed green teas than Chinese pan-fired teas. Efforts to cultivate rooibos outside the small region where it grows have proved unsuccessful, as it is dependent on the region's unique climate, soils, and other components of the ecosystem. Rooibos production is being threatened by climate change, and many farmers of rooibos live and operate in extreme poverty, complicating measures to adapt to the changing climate.[1]Rooibos is often promoted as having health benefits and/or medicinal properties. As with tea and most herbal teas, these benefits are often overstated, but some of them have been backed to varying degrees by scientific research. Rooibos is frequently promoted as having antioxidant activity comparable to that of tea; a study validated this for both green and red rooibos.[2] The antioxidant activity of rooibos, has been shown in mice to protect against radiation damage, probably by luteolin and possibly other antioxidants neutralizing the free radicals formed by exposure to gamma rays.[3] In addition, rooibos is widely used in traditional medicine for respiratory ailments such as asthma. A study on rats found significant dose-dependent bronchodilatory effect, providing a sound basis for its use in treating respiratory conditions.[4] Another study on rats found that rooibos provided significant protection against liver damage, in concentrations equivalent to that typically used when humans drink rooibos tea.[5] Topical use of rooibos in skin care products Topical application of rooibos (such as its use in creams, cosmetics, and sunscreen) also shows some promise of health benefits. One study found that rooibos, honeybush and green tea, all had tumor-preventing properties in mouse skin, suggesting that these teas hold promise for preventing skin cancer.[6] More recent work has uncovered likely mechanisms by which topical use of rooibos and honeybush reduce tumour promotion, inflammation, and oxidative stress.[7] ",

            "tea_category": "Tulsi / Holy Basil",
            "about": "Tulsi tea, also called holy basil tea, is an herbal tea made from the tulsi or holy basil plant, Ocimum tenuiflorum, sometimes named Ocimum sanctum, a close relative of sweet basil. Tulsi is important in Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India, and the plant also has spiritual significance in Hinduism. The leaf is used both as a seasoning and in herbal tea, both on its own and in blends. Tulsi is usually classified into two varieties, Rama tulsi, which has green leaves, and Krishna Tulsi, with red or purple leaves. Each of these varieties is named for a Hindu avatar, Krishna, and Rama. Another variety of this species is also used as a seasoning in Thai food; this variety is called Thai holy basil or kha phrao, and is not the same species as the usual 'Thai basil' which is a variety of the sweet basil plant Ocimum basilicum. Yet another species of basil, African basil, Ocimum gratissimum, is sometimes called vana tulsi. Although sometimes described as a third variety of 'holy basil' or 'tulsi', Vana tulsi is more closely related to African basil and the (non-native) 'wild' basil of Hawaii. Tulsi is easy to grow and has requirements similar to sweet basil; it likes sun, and can be grown as a perennial in tropical climates and an annual in colder climates. Tulsi has been studied for a wide variety of health uses and purposes; although the research is young and some of it is not fully conclusive, there is evidence that the plant has a wide variety of potential health benefits. Many aspects of its traditional use in Ayurvedic medicine are starting to be validated by studies on rats and mice, and a few on humans. Herbalists classify tulsi as an adaptogen, an herb that is non-toxic and safe for general use, and that has a normalizing effect on physiology. There are, however, a few potential concerns with the use of this particular plant. In vitro studies have found evidence that extract of the seed and leaf of tulsi has antiviral properties[1], and stimulates the immune system.[2] A study on rats found that it can protect against liver damage caused by a toxic chemical.[3] A study on mice found an extract of the herb inhibited the progression of breast cancer.[4] In vivo studies on lung cancer cells found that tulsi can induce cell death and suppress the growth of cancer cells.[5] A study on rabbits found that tulsi prevented damage caused by stress, partly due to its antioxidant content.[6] Holy basil has been used to treat depression and anxiety. A recent human clinical study found that the plant extract had significant effects at treating both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.[7] The plant has also been found in studies on mice to have nootropic properties, aiding memory and preventing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.[8] There is also evidence from studies on rats that the plant can significantly lower blood sugar, both in normal and diabetic rats, justifying its traditional use for treating diabetes. An alcohol extract of holy basil was compared to the drug Tolbutamide, and showed about 70-90(percent) of the same blood-sugar-lowering effect as this drug.[9] Most of the potential side-effects of tulsi are not acute effects but rather, long-term points of caution that might not be immediately apparent to casual herbal tea drinkers. The Ocimum tenuiflorum plant is able to grow in areas with a high concentration of chromium, which would normally harm most plants; because it tolerates high levels of chromium, it can accumulate the metal in its leaves to potentially toxic levels. Chromium can damage the liver and kidneys. Tulsi grown in polluted areas is thus not safe for human consumption.[10] You can avoid this problem by buying organic tulsi and being familiar with the source of the herb, or by growing your own herb in soil that you are familiar with. When dealing with the pure plant itself, when contamination is not an issue, the main side-effect associated with tulsi is that it functions as a blood thinner. There is some evidence that tulsi can slow blood clotting, with an effect comparable to that of aspirin;[11] it should be used with caution in situations where slowed blood clotting could be harmful, such as before surgery or childbirth, or in people who are taking prescription blood thinning medications such as the drug Warfarin. This effect is relatively common among other herbs; chamomile is another herb with similar properties. ",

            "doc": "Tulsi tea, also called holy basil tea, is an herbal tea made from the tulsi or holy basil plant, Ocimum tenuiflorum, sometimes named Ocimum sanctum, a close relative of sweet basil. Tulsi is important in Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India, and the plant also has spiritual significance in Hinduism. The leaf is used both as a seasoning and in herbal tea, both on its own and in blends. Tulsi is usually classified into two varieties, Rama tulsi, which has green leaves, and Krishna Tulsi, with red or purple leaves. Each of these varieties is named for a Hindu avatar, Krishna, and Rama. Another variety of this species is also used as a seasoning in Thai food; this variety is called Thai holy basil or kha phrao, and is not the same species as the usual 'Thai basil' which is a variety of the sweet basil plant Ocimum basilicum. Yet another species of basil, African basil, Ocimum gratissimum, is sometimes called vana tulsi. Although sometimes described as a third variety of 'holy basil' or 'tulsi', Vana tulsi is more closely related to African basil and the (non-native) 'wild' basil of Hawaii. Tulsi is easy to grow and has requirements similar to sweet basil; it likes sun, and can be grown as a perennial in tropical climates and an annual in colder climates. Tulsi has been studied for a wide variety of health uses and purposes; although the research is young and some of it is not fully conclusive, there is evidence that the plant has a wide variety of potential health benefits. Many aspects of its traditional use in Ayurvedic medicine are starting to be validated by studies on rats and mice, and a few on humans. Herbalists classify tulsi as an adaptogen, an herb that is non-toxic and safe for general use, and that has a normalizing effect on physiology.

I recommend using much less leaf than one would use for other types of tulsi; the finely-broken leaf infuses quickly and thoroughly, and takes up less space, so it's easy to overbrew and make an overly strong cup.

A defining aspect of wellness tea is that the flavor and aroma of the tea, while important, is a secondary characteristic. Wellness teas are central to herbalism, although there are also other ways of administering herbs. While most people associate herbal teas with medicinal teas, some medicinal teas contain the tea plant Camellia Sinensis and are thus not strictly herbal teas. Interestingly, the use of the tea plant originated in ancient China as medicine. Also, many herbal teas are blended primarily for taste rather than health or medicinal properties. The boundary between wellness teas and other teas is blurry, as many teas are produced, marketed, and consumed both for their taste as well as health benefits. To avoid subjective judgments, RateTea lists as 'wellness teas' those that are identified or marketed as such. The exception to this rule is that we classify some types of tea (such as green tea, chamomile tea, hibiscus tea, etc.) that are widely consumed as beverages under these categories rather than as a wellness tea. We also do our best to classify teas as wellness teas when they contain ingredients not generally recognized as safe for beverage consumption, or herbs with strong medicinal effects, such as licorice or valerian. Tea and herbal teas that are marketed as beverages are not as strictly regulated by the FDA as some drugs are.

                "I liked this more than most Yogi blends I've tried, probably because it has tropical fruit flavors I enjoy greatly (mango and passion fruit), a spicy kick, and 'only' nine ingredients. [For the uninitiated, that's extreme simplicity for Yogi Tea.] Those ingredients are (organic): ginger, cinnamon, rooibos, mango flavor, licorice root, fennel, passion fruit flavor, cardamom pod, and mango. Though mild, the dry-bag aroma was pleasing, more of the lower-middle tier ingredients like cardamom, fennel and licorice than the top ones. Ginger and mango came out more in the in-cup aroma. The mango really came alive in the taste, and balanced nicely with a rather spicy version of ginger they use (that I like a lot). Not being much of a fan of ginger as a stand-alone flavor, I like how it plays nice with the fruits, fennel and licorice here, and I must reiterate: I really liked the unusually spicy kick their choice of ginger has. It's a very warming beverage as a result, and best drunk hot (the cooled version definitely flattens, noticeably). As a hot herbal tea, it's one of the top handful I've had flavor-wise. I only knock a little off value because, like other Yogi teas, it can get a bit pricey, and because of the 16-bag 'shrinkflation' in their boxes. The medicinal/wellness claim of this blend is that it aids digestion, based on the role of ginger in Ayurvedic medicine. I digested the tea fine, so I suppose that's a good start!",
                "Some Yogi teas have bazillions of ingredients, while smelling and/or tasting like disjointed mishmashes of unrelated flavors, and/or spice-infused clippings from a lawn-mower bag. Good news: not this one! Kava Stress Relief seems to have some coherent and pleasant character to it. Regardless of the veracity of its anti-anxiety and relaxation claims, this herbal tea does make a pleasant bedtime beverage. The dry-bag, in-cup and wet-bag scents were remarkably alike (this often isn't true in herbal teas!): mild cinnamon, sweet and creamy with a noticeable vanilla overtone, and a fruity element faintly reminiscent of wild plums or Concord grape jelly. That sounds disjointed too, but actually seemed to play well together as the molecules docked themselves on olfactory sensors. Vanilla is not a listed ingredient, so I'm guessing the toasted rice, organic hazelnut flavoring and sarsaparilla combined on the creaminess. The taste was a little different, with the cinnamon still there, but noticeably chocolatey (perhaps from the carob pod), sarsaparilla more prominent, and not as much fruitiness as in the aromas. That's still a pleasant combination, however, and this was an enjoyable drink. A more-concentrated version of this, sweetened and carbonated, would make a decent root beer. I have no clue what kava is supposed to taste like, so that element remains a mystery-unless that's what provides a noticeable but not cloying level of bitterness to the finish. A note of caution: it does get noticeably more bitter (especially in aftertaste) after cooling down to room temperature. ",
                "A co-worker who drinks a lot of medicinal herbal teas left me this and regurgitated not the tea itself, but the claim that it 'helps reduce free radicals'. My response: 'How? By imprisoning the radicals?' Smart-aleck retorts aside, I'm wary of teas that make a bunch of health claims that aren't solidly backed medically. So I won't evaluate those, especially not knowing how many radicals I have released vs. incarcerated in my physiological justice system. :-) As with many Yogi offerings, this has a bunch of ingredients-10 to be specific, led by green tea, and including four (alfalfa, grapeseed extract, emblic fruit/amla extract, and Irish moss) I've not had in tea before. My aunt was big into distributing Shaklee nutritional supplements when I was a kid, and used to supply my parents with surplus alfalfa tablets she couldn't sell, so I know how that stuff tastes alone (like lawn clippings). I've used grapeseed oil, so that's no bother. The embic fruit appears in scientifically dubious Ayurvedic medicine, but doesn't seem harmful in and of itself, from what I've read. A bunch of different plants are called Irish moss (seaweed, perennial terrestrial ground covers, and more), so I don't know what the heck that is. I've had tea made almost wholly from Icelandic moss (a lichen), but I don't think this is that. Oh well...down the hatch! The dry bag and in-cup smells are very weak, mostly reminiscent of green tea with earthy, straw-like tone, neither particularly pleasant nor offputting. The flavor basically is a taste-bud rendering of same-stronger, but only in a relative way (say, 4 on a 1-10 scale of power vs. 2 at best for the aroma). Aftertaste was stronger still (say, 5 on the same scale, but still far from blow-your-face-off potency). As for flavor quality, my best word to describe it is: weird. It's a haystraw/green-tea mix, with an occasional whiff of a somewhat astringent floral like marigold. The wet-bag smell brings out the floral element more, and despite being the least important or useful stage, actually is the most pleasant part of the sensory experience overall. In summary, I only would buy this stuff if I believed its putative health claims. I don't, so that's that, for this, for me!",
                "As medicinal herbals go, this one was OK-not as OK as Oklahoma pronounced itself on 1970s license plates, but OK nonetheless. The dry bag gave off a pronounced licorice aroma, which doesn't bother me, since I'm cool with licorice. But some folks hate licorice, and I predict they won't take a shine to the smell or taste of this product. Licorice still is the most dominant flavor, especially on the back end (finish) and aftertaste. I can pick up the lemon part, but it's minor. The only other among its many herbs I could tease out of the flavor was fennel, which I also enjoy in tea. The taste could be more potent, but perhaps that also would ratchet up a faint yet noticeable dirty or muddy element to the taste. Some might call it 'earthy', but to me that term suggests more of a moist-leaves or pleasant forest-soil scent, whereas a lot of medicinal and complex herbal teas to me give off a vibe of, 'Here's a mystery root with some gobs of field dirt still attached...chew on it.' Fortunately that element is indeed faint and not in every sip, or I'd rate this tea a lot lower. It just occasionally wafts up the sniffer from cup or mouth, and goes away quickly. All in all, it's not a bad call for a drinkable, fairly smooth herbal ensemble. I haven't tried it with a sore throat yet, so I can't vouch for its claimed medicinal effects. As with a lot of this company's offerings, it is fairly pricey at 16 bags for $4.50-$8.00 at most of your health stores or Sprouts/Whole Foods type supermarkets, and $5.79 on the website as of Sep. 2021.

The taste was a little different, with the cinnamon still there, but noticeably chocolatey (perhaps from the carob pod), sarsaparilla more prominent, and not as much fruitiness as in the aromas. That's still a pleasant combination, however, and this was an enjoyable drink. A more-concentrated version of this, sweetened and carbonated, would make a decent root beer. I have no clue what kava is supposed to taste like, so that element remains a mystery-unless that's what provides a noticeable but not cloying level of bitterness to the finish. A note of caution: it does get noticeably more bitter (especially in aftertaste) after cooling down to room temperature.  A co-worker who drinks a lot of medicinal herbal teas left me this and regurgitated not the tea itself, but the claim that it 'helps reduce free radicals'. My response: 'How? By imprisoning the radicals?' Smart-aleck retorts aside, I'm wary of teas that make a bunch of health claims that aren't solidly backed medically. So I won't evaluate those, especially not knowing how many radicals I have released vs. incarcerated in my physiological justice system. :-) As with many Yogi offerings, this has a bunch of ingredients-10 to be specific, led by green tea, and including four (alfalfa, grapeseed extract, emblic fruit/amla extract, and Irish moss) I've not had in tea before. My aunt was big into distributing Shaklee nutritional supplements when I was a kid, and used to supply my parents with surplus alfalfa tablets she couldn't sell, so I know how that stuff tastes alone (like lawn clippings). I've used grapeseed oil, so that's no bother. The embic fruit appears in scientifically dubious Ayurvedic medicine, but doesn't seem harmful in and of itself, from what I've read. A bunch of different plants are called Irish moss (seaweed, perennial terrestrial ground covers, and more), so I don't know what the heck that is. I've had tea made almost wholly from Icelandic moss (a lichen), but I don't think this is that. Oh well...down the hatch! The dry bag and in-cup smells are very weak, mostly reminiscent of green tea with earthy, straw-like tone, neither particularly pleasant nor offputting. The flavor basically is a taste-bud rendering of same-stronger, but only in a relative way (say, 4 on a 1-10 scale of power vs. 2 at best for the aroma). Aftertaste was stronger still (say, 5 on the same scale, but still far from blow-your-face-off potency). As for flavor quality, my best word to describe it is: weird. It's a haystraw/green-tea mix, with an occasional whiff of a somewhat astringent floral like marigold. The wet-bag smell brings out the floral element more, and despite being the least important or useful stage, actually is the most pleasant part of the sensory experience overall. In summary, I only would buy this stuff if I believed its putative health claims. I don't, so that's that, for this, for me! As medicinal herbals go, this one was OK-not as OK as Oklahoma pronounced itself on 1970s license plates, but OK nonetheless. The dry bag gave off a pronounced licorice aroma, which doesn't bother me, since I'm cool with licorice. But some folks hate licorice, and I predict they won't take a shine to the smell or taste of this product. Licorice still is the most dominant flavor, especially on the back end (finish) and aftertaste. I can pick up the lemon part, but it's minor. The only other among its many herbs I could tease out of the flavor was fennel, which I also enjoy in tea. The taste could be more potent, but perhaps that also would ratchet up a faint yet noticeable dirty or muddy element to the taste. Some might call it 'earthy', but to me that term suggests more of a moist-leaves or pleasant forest-soil scent, whereas a lot of medicinal and complex herbal teas to me give off a vibe of, 'Here's a mystery root with some gobs of field dirt still attached...chew on it.' Fortunately that element is indeed faint and not in every sip, or I'd rate this tea a lot lower. It just occasionally wafts up the sniffer from cup or mouth, and goes away quickly. All in all, it's not a bad call for a drinkable, fairly smooth herbal ensemble. I haven't tried it with a sore throat yet, so I can't vouch for its claimed medicinal effects. As with a lot of this company's offerings, it is fairly pricey at 16 bags for $4.50-$8.00 at most of your health stores or Sprouts/Whole Foods type supermarkets, and $5.79 on the website as of Sep. 2021.  Cup at home, made from a teabag containing a mixture of ginger root, liquorice root, elderflower, sweet fennel seed, lemon verbana leaf, tumeric root, lemon essential oil flavour, lemon whole, lemon myrtle leaf, all sprinkled with manuka honey flavour. Pours somewhat hazy straw with no sediment. Clear aroma of liquorice, with touches of ginger and fennel. Sweet flavour of the above-mentioned ingredients and of honey, offset to a degree by the dry notes of lemon. Sweet aftertaste of honey and liquorice. A nice one. Reasonable price, too (33 DKK per 20 teabags). 8 4 4 78 1 teabag / 250 ml; 100 C; 15 min. Review #184 "

Passionflower tea is produced from an infusion of the whole dried plant, including stems, leaves, root, and vine tendrils. The dried herb is also commonly included in herbal blends intended for medicinal use, usually those aimed to promote relaxation or reduce anxiety. The passionflower plant also produces an edible fruit, called a maypop.

There are also more safety concerns with this herb at common doses, which are discussed below. Passionflower has a long history of traditional use for a wide range of conditions.

The anti-anxiety properties of passionflower have been better studied than other uses. One study of 60 adults undergoing surgery found that using passionflower before surgery reduced anxiety without causing sedation.[1] The herb seems to act similarly to the benzodiazepine class of medications. However, unlike these medications, passionflower does not seem to cause the problems of tolerance and dependency; one study on mice found not only that long-term passionflower use does not result in dependency, but that the herb is able to prevent or mitigate the effects of benzodiazepine dependency.[2] Passionflower, as the name suggests, has been traditionally used as an aphrodisiac, to increase sexual desire. There is evidence from a study on mice that passionflower can have an aphrodisiac effect.[3] Passionflower is also used as a cough suppressant; a study on mice also found evidence supporting antitussive (cough suppressant) effects, similar to codeine.[4] According to WebMD's page on passionflower, passionflower is not safe for use during pregnancy because it can cause uterine contractions. WebMD lists dizziness, confusion, irregular muscle action and coordination, altered consciousness, and inflamed blood vessels as potential side effects.

Yaupon is the most cold-hardy caffeinated plant, naturally growing in regions colder than the tea plant, and able to be grown significantly farther north and in significantly colder areas than its native range. It is more popular as a landscape plant, with at least six horticultural varieties available, including ones with weeping, dwarf, and columnar habits.

                "This is really great tea! I love that it's grown natively in the United States. It is full of flavor and very satisfying, and it doesn't go bitter even with a long steep time. In fact, partly because of the fairly long steep time of five minutes, I was expecting to only get one or two really good cups out of it -- but I easily got three. I'm not sure if the difference is between these are made from holly leaves rather than tea leaves, but the flavor infuses really well, even in contrast to looseleaf teas that I've tried. Note: I did NOT use the entire packet, as suggested on the box. I only made enough for one cup at a time. I used about 1/4 of the pack and simply resealed it with a clip. I'm looking forward to trying the medium and dark flavors!",
                "I love the smell of the dry leaf of this stuff...it has a potent and very pleasant aroma, similar to Yerba mate and Guayusa but unique. I find it much more pleasing! Upon brewing, I don't like the taste quite as much. It tastes peppery, and the yerba-mate-like sweetness is more of a background flavor. The aroma is complex, and contains tones of vanilla, but is mostly herbaceous, and slightly vegetal and woody. Like the roasted version, I can see this being a bit of an acquired taste, like some oolongs that I didn't like as much the first time I tried them. I agree with the commercial description, that it is tart and earthy, fragrant, and vegetal. I find it actually too tart for my tastes when drunk hot; it seemed a bit harsh. I enjoyed it much more when it cooled to room temperature. As with the dark roast, the leaf infuses very slowly and I recommend a minimum of a 3 minute infusion, probably longer. I think I prefer the roasted stuff. As with it, it did not seem or feel particularly strongly caffeinated to me...it seemed more like drinking an herbal tea.",
                "I finally got to try Yaupon, and this was the first one I tried! I was excited! I liked it, and I thought this batch was on par with some of the better examples of mate, and the only batch of guayusa that I've tried (the closest thing I have to compare it to). Aroma of the dry leaf and brewed cup is vaguely reminiscent of Yerba Mate or Guayusa, probably more like Guayusa, but there is a strange, dark, herbaceous quality that I find is unique...it reminds me almost of the quality in the aroma of Australian Lemon Myrtle other than the lemon scent. Brews a surprisingly clear cup. I sense that the roast on this is pretty light--I've had much darker mate, and it's nowhere near as roasty as coffee or hojicha (roasted green tea). It's more like an oolong with a medium roast. Much less sweet than typical Yerba mate, and I like that, but I find it has a surprisingly sweet, honey-like finish. The overall character of the cup is oolong-like, with a mild roast and honey-like sweetness. There's a pleasant fruitiness in the aroma that is completely un tea-like. A lot like mate, I found I needed to acquire a taste for this. I enjoyed it much more after setting it aside and coming back to it a few days later than I did the first time I tried it. I also noticed that I felt hungry after drinking it. It did not seem very strongly caffeinated to me...I'd be curious what the actual content is if anyone measures it. The leaves are very slow to infuse. I liked steeping it for 3 minutes (any less and it's too weak) and I was able to get a second cup out of it easily. People who like very strong tea or black coffee will probably want to use more leaf and a longer steeping time. I look forward to trying and reviewing the green version!",

Yaupon is the most cold-hardy caffeinated plant, naturally growing in regions colder than the tea plant, and able to be grown significantly farther north and in significantly colder areas than its native range. It is more popular as a landscape plant, with at least six horticultural varieties available, including ones with weeping, dwarf, and columnar habits. Like other native plants, when planted in or near its native range, Yaupon supports native wildlife like the Eastern bluebird pictured on the left. This is really great tea! I love that it's grown natively in the United States. It is full of flavor and very satisfying, and it doesn't go bitter even with a long steep time. In fact, partly because of the fairly long steep time of five minutes, I was expecting to only get one or two really good cups out of it -- but I easily got three. I'm not sure if the difference is between these are made from holly leaves rather than tea leaves, but the flavor infuses really well, even in contrast to looseleaf teas that I've tried. Note: I did NOT use the entire packet, as suggested on the box. I only made enough for one cup at a time. I used about 1/4 of the pack and simply resealed it with a clip. I'm looking forward to trying the medium and dark flavors! I love the smell of the dry leaf of this stuff...it has a potent and very pleasant aroma, similar to Yerba mate and Guayusa but unique. I find it much more pleasing! Upon brewing, I don't like the taste quite as much. It tastes peppery, and the yerba-mate-like sweetness is more of a background flavor. The aroma is complex, and contains tones of vanilla, but is mostly herbaceous, and slightly vegetal and woody. Like the roasted version, I can see this being a bit of an acquired taste, like some oolongs that I didn't like as much the first time I tried them. I agree with the commercial description, that it is tart and earthy, fragrant, and vegetal. I find it actually too tart for my tastes when drunk hot; it seemed a bit harsh. I enjoyed it much more when it cooled to room temperature. As with the dark roast, the leaf infuses very slowly and I recommend a minimum of a 3 minute infusion, probably longer. I think I prefer the roasted stuff. As with it, it did not seem or feel particularly strongly caffeinated to me...it seemed more like drinking an herbal tea. I finally got to try Yaupon, and this was the first one I tried! I was excited! I liked it, and I thought this batch was on par with some of the better examples of mate, and the only batch of guayusa that I've tried (the closest thing I have to compare it to). Aroma of the dry leaf and brewed cup is vaguely reminiscent of Yerba Mate or Guayusa, probably more like Guayusa, but there is a strange, dark, herbaceous quality that I find is unique...it reminds me almost of the quality in the aroma of Australian Lemon Myrtle other than the lemon scent. Brews a surprisingly clear cup. I sense that the roast on this is pretty light--I've had much darker mate, and it's nowhere near as roasty as coffee or hojicha (roasted green tea). It's more like an oolong with a medium roast. Much less sweet than typical Yerba mate, and I like that, but I find it has a surprisingly sweet, honey-like finish. The overall character of the cup is oolong-like, with a mild roast and honey-like sweetness. There's a pleasant fruitiness in the aroma that is completely un tea-like. A lot like mate, I found I needed to acquire a taste for this. I enjoyed it much more after setting it aside and coming back to it a few days later than I did the first time I tried it. I also noticed that I felt hungry after drinking it. It did not seem very strongly caffeinated to me...I'd be curious what the actual content is if anyone measures it. The leaves are very slow to infuse. I liked steeping it for 3 minutes (any less and it's too weak) and I was able to get a second cup out of it easily. People who like very strong tea or black coffee will probably want to use more leaf and a longer steeping time. I look forward to trying and reviewing the green version! I have been drinking this tea for the last 6 months. It has become my favorite caffeinated beverage. Now that it is summer in Texas, I have been drinking Texas Yaupon Tea iced, too."

            "about": "Yerba mat\u00e9 (pronounced 'mah-tay'), often just called mate and sometimes called Paraguay tea, is an herb that has stimulant properties. Yerba mat\u00e9 is made from a species of holly, Ilex paraguariensis, and is one of several species of holly that naturally contain caffeine, others being guayusa and yaupon. In addition to caffeine, yerba mat\u00e9 contains other chemicals that make its effects somewhat different from those of tea or coffee. Because yerba mat\u00e9 is prepared similarly to tea, the drink made from it is often referred to as mate tea or yerba mate tea. There is a lot of variability in the form and processing of Yerba mat\u00e9, including the portion of stem, leaf, and dust included, whether it is green or roasted, whether or not it has been smoked or unsmoked during drying, and the degree to which it has been aged. On RateTea we list only pure mate in this category. Blends containing mate among flavorings or other ingredients are classified as flavored yerba mat\u00e9, unless they also contain tea, in which case they are classified as miscellaneous blends. Common flavorings include spices, often leading to the creation of 'mate chai' or 'chai mate' blends, a reference to masala chai or spiced tea. Yerba mate is native to South America, but it is typically cultivated in large monoculture plantations in a very different environment from the rich, biodiverse ecosystems which the plant naturally occurs in. Many of these plantations, like that pictured on the right, have exposed soil which can contribute to soil loss. Using a cover crop can protect the soil. Mate production contains many steps, some of which are necessary, but others of which are sometimes omitted and lead to different finished forms. Mate is gathered and then briefly blanched over a fire, to stop the natural oxidation that occurs in the leaf, making its production somewhat analagous to green tea, more similar to pan-fired or baked Chinese green teas, less so like Japanese steamed green teas. After blanching, a second drying phase begins. This stage must be thorough, as the leaf is poisonous until fully dried. Some varieties of mate are dried over wood fires, often described as smoking, a process which imparts a smoky aroma to the finished leaf. After drying, the leaves are milled, and then the mate is left to age. The ageing usually is carried out for a minimum of six months, and sometimes for as long as two years. Some mate is roasted, giving it a darker color, a bit like coffee. Dark-roast mate tends to be milder in flavor than coffee, often sweeter than unroasted mate, but it also has an aroma that is slightly more reminiscent of coffee, and more suggestive of cocoa or chocolate. Traditionally, yerba mat\u00e9 is served in a dried and hollowed gourd, with the loose leaf kept in the hot water. Sometimes the gourd would be protected with leather or even metal. Vessels in the shape of a gourd are also made out of various materials, including wood or metal (even silver). The gourd is then passed around and shared among a group of people. The drink is sucked through a straw, which has a built-in strainer at the base. These straws are often ornate and made of silver. Yerba mat\u00e9 has not been as widely studied as tea, and there have been mixed results as to its health effects. It has been found to have significant antioxidant content which is likely preserved when it is consumed as tea.[1][2] It also contains vitamins and minerals, including vitamins C, B1, and B2, and phosphorus, iron, and calcium.[2] However, there is a single case report of consumption of very large amounts of Yerba mate over a long period of time being pointed to as a likely cause of liver damage.[3] The findings on yerba mat\u00e9's effects on cancer are mixed, but can be explained when looking deeper at the various studies; two reviews have concluded that drinking hot mat\u00e9 is probably carcinogenic to humans, but that the effect was probably caused by the fact that it was a hot beverage and was scalding the mouth and throat, not by any substance in the mat\u00e9 causing cancer.[2][4] Although some epidemiological studies have found substantial increases in cancer risk associated with heavy (1 liter daily) yerba mat\u00e9 consumption, it is not clear whether this is due to the mat\u00e9, to contaminants present in the mat\u00e9, or is attributable to the mat\u00e9 increasing absorption of harmful chemicals in tobacco or other drugs; tobacco and alcohol use were high in the groups which showed increased cancer risk.[2] Contrasting with these studies, Yerba mat\u00e9 has also shown strong anti-cancer activity in a number of in vitro studies.[2] Based on this research, it makes sense to be cautious about drinking mate from a straw, being careful to sip it slowly to avoid burning the mouth and throat, to obtain yerba mate from a source known to be free of contaminants, and to avoid heavy tobacco and alcohol use if you also consume large amounts of mate. There is no evidence that moderate mate use can cause any negative health effects other than by these three mechanisms, and other research points to potential health benefits and nutritional value for this drink, possibly involving anti-cancer potential.

                "As black-tea blends go, this is a bit above-average in my experience, and worth purchasing at a discount if you seek a coffee alternative with a caffeine kick. Mine was supplied at a hotel, and I took a couple extra bags home to try in my own well water for fair-comparison's sake. Bigelow delivers extra caffeine through the added ingredient, 'black tea extract'. In essence, they take concentrated tea and add it back to black tea to dose up the caffeine, and presumably, taste too. This is a simple yet clever approach, and it works, but not as well as I thought it would. The flavor is just a hint stronger than most of their black blends, but not so much so that it slaps you in the face and proclaims that message with startling unambiguity. Yet it still is good, with a noticeable bitterness that stops just short of being unpleasant. It does remind me a lot of my wife's Connemara Kitchen Irish Breakfast tea in overall flavor, though not quite as rich and full-bodied. I can't tell you if this is the black-tea counterpart of Mountain Dew on the caffeine front. Since I'm largely caffeine-immune after three decades of drinking a liter or two of Diet Dr Pepper a day, you'll have to rely on someone else for a fair evaluation of the energy-boosting effect. The stated dose on their website is 60-90 mg per cup. ",

These blends typically contain tea, and may consist only of pure tea with added caffeine, but often are flavored teas that contain other ingredients, both for flavor and energy-enhancing properties. Energy-enhancing ingredients may include ginseng or other herbal stimulants, and they may also contain green tea extract or other extracts. RateTea recommends using caution when drinking any tea which contains added caffeine.

Blends of tea with other ingredients, where the other ingredient is the main ingredient and not just a flavoring for the tea, may be put in this category. This category also includes blends of two or more of green, black, oolong and white teas that also contain other ingredients. Blends of more than two types of tea we classify as miscellaneous tea-only blends, under pure (true) teas. This category also encompasses blends that contain tea, but not as the primary ingredient, such as blends of rooibos, honeybush, or yerba mat\u00e9 with black or green teas and other ingredients. In general, we also place blends in this category if they contain both tea and some other caffeinated ingredient, such as mate, guarana, guayusa, yaupon, or coffee. Teas in this category may include any number of herbs or other ingredients. Most teas in this category, unless they are decaffeinated, contain caffeine; the amount of caffeine varies widely, however, and some of these blends contain very little or even negligible caffeine, especially if tea is only a minor ingredient in an otherwise caffeine-free blend. However, strictly caffeine-free teas will be listed under herbal teas. RateTea classifies some teas marketed as 'green teas' or 'white teas' as 'Miscellaneous Blends' because they are blended with other varieties of tea and various herbs or other ingredients.",

                "For a few years, Tazo and Bigelow, in particular, have gone on a bender of producing explicitly dessert-flavored blends, which doesn't bother me, even as it might annoy some tea purists. Hey, who doesn't like some yummy sweet treats after a good dinner? However, Bigelow may have overplayed its hand here and missed the mark with regard to advertised flavor experience. It's only because I liked the tea anyway (even if it didn't taste much like the name) that I didn't rate it below the big five-oh. Let's start with the ingredients. This is an unusual roster, to say the least: black tea, rose hips, green tea, chamomile, chicory root, natural coconut and almond flavors, 'other natural flavors', and licorice root. That's a lot of things nominally flavoring the black tea, but because green tea is also an ingredient, it's a 'miscellaneous blend' under RateTea's rules, which are very clear about this. In case you were wondering... So what does this unique assembly of components do? Smell and taste like chamomile-flavored black tea, for the most part. I suppose the coconut and maybe almond are detectable with effort, especially in aftertaste. Still, chamomile so dominates the other secondary ingredients, and almost overpowers what must be a fairly mild, unassuming black tea with only enough bitterness to say, 'Hey, I do exist here.' Rose hips and green tea are the second and third ingredients, and I'm just not detecting them. I don't necessarily expect to taste the last ingredient in a big blend-licorice, in this case-and indeed, I don't. The wet-bag aroma was the only place I picked up on a floral/fruity element implied by the rose hips, but the more dominant wet scent puzzled me for a short bit until I figured it out: any of those freshly printed, large college textbooks with glossy paper, opened for the first time. That's a rather pleasant aroma to me, but not something I expected in a wet tea bag. At least the taste or in-cup smell isn't anything like this; most folks don't want to drink their mechanical-engineering problems.",

                "Reviewing the loose version here, but I've got a 10-bag sampler pack too, and don't notice any appreciable difference between them in terms of aroma or flavor. This is another among numerous green-black tea blends Murchie's makes (in this case also with roses, cornflowers and jasmine). They largely have mastered what apparently is a difficult art of green-black tea blending and flavoring, it seems, based on the body of results from them all. If you are planning a wedding and decide to use this tea, I doubt guests would complain, and most likely would like it, especially for its uncommon flavor blend. Given the presence of the red and blue flowers, which are visually striking in loose-leaf form, I was surprised the dry-bag/dry-leaf and in-cup aromas weren't stronger. Still, they were pleasant, and definitely gave off all the stated essences: jasmine, floral, and of course, tea. The fruity element came out more in the aftertaste and the back of the throat, whereas the jasmine was more up-front, lending a chameleon-like performance to the chugging experience (in a pleasant way). The aftertaste does linger quite a bit more in the bagged tea than in the loose, but that's about the only even minor difference I could tell between them. The tea blend itself is fairly smooth and creamy, slightly astringent, not really bitter at all. This is not the very best of their blends to me, since I think it could be a notch stronger all around, but still is solid in quality and well worth ordering if you like floral/fruity flavored-tea combinations. The somewhat delicate nature and complexity of this blend might tickle the fancy of more-refined tea connoisseurs than I. ",
